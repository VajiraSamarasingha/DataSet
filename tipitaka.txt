Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samæsambuddhassa
Veneration to the Exalted One, the
Homage-Worthy, the Perfectly
Self-Enlightened.

The Buddha is an Arahat and he is worthy of the highest veneration. All
beings including devas and Brahmæs venerate the Buddha because the
Buddha is the Supreme One, who has extinguished all defilements, who has
become perfectly self-enlightened through realization of the Four Noble
Truths, and who is endowed with the six great qualities of glory, namely,
Issariya (supremacy), Dhamma (Knowledge of the Path to Nibbæna), Yasa
(fame and following), Sirø (noble splendour of appearance), Kæma (power of
accomplishment) and Payatta (diligent mindfulness).

GUIDE TO TIPI¿AKA
Preface
The Tipi¥aka is an extensive body of Canonical Pæ¹i literature in
which are enshrined the Teachings of Gotama Buddha expounded for
forty-five years from the time of his Enlightenment to his parinibbæna.
The discourses of the Buddha cover a wide field of subjects and are
made up of exhortations, expositions and injunctions.
Even from the earliest times some kind of classification and
systematization of the Buddha's Teachings had been made to facilitate
memorization, since only verbal transmission was employed to pass on
the Teachings from generation to generation. Three months after the
parinibbæna of the Buddha, the great disciples recited together all the
Teachings of their Master, after compiling them systematically and
carefully classifying them under different heads into specialized sections.
The general discourses and sermons intended for both the bhikkhus
and lay disciples, delivered by the Buddha on various occasions (together
with a few discourses delivered by some of his distinguished disciples), are
collected and classified in a great division known as the Suttanta Pi¥aka.
The great division in which are incorporated injunctions and
admonitions of the Buddha on modes of conduct, and restraints on both
bodily and verbal actions of bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs, which form rules
of discipline for them, is called the Vinaya Pi¥aka.
The philosophical aspect of the Buddha's Teaching, more profound
and abstract than the discourses of the Suttanta Pi¥aka, is classified under
the great division known as the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka. Abhidhamma deals
with ultimate Truths, expounds ultimate Truths and investigates Mind
and Matter and the relationship between them.
All that the Buddha taught forms the subject matter and substance
of the Pæ¹i Canon, which is divided into these three divisions called
Pi¥akas — literally baskets. Hence Tipi¥aka means three baskets or three
separate divisions of the Buddha's Teaching. Here the metaphor 'basket'
signifies not so much the function of 'storing up' anything put into it as
its use as a receptacle in which things are handed on or passed on from
one to another like carrying away of earth from an excavation site by a
line of workers.
The Tipi¥aka into which the Pæ¹i Canon is systematically divided
and handed down from generation to generation together with
Commentaries forms the huge collection of literary works which the

19

bhikkhus of the Order have to learn, study and memorize in discharge of
their gantha dhura, the duty of studying.
Acknowledgement
It is a great privilege for me to have been entrusted with the task of
compiling this 'Guide to Tipi¥aka'. So far as it is known, there is not a
single work that deals, in outline, with the whole of Tipi¥aka. It is
sincerely hoped that this compilation will be found useful and handy by
the general reader who wishes to be provided with a bird's eye view of
the vast and magnificent canonical scenery which represents all that the
Buddha (and some of his disciples) had taught and all that has been
treasured in the Tipi¥aka.
In compiling this work, the Pæ¹i Texts as approved by the Sixth
International Buddhist Synod together with their Burmese translations
have been closely adhered to. Acknowledgements are due to Dagon U
San Ngwe and U Myo Myint who provided notes for some of the
chapters. Additional information and facts were gathered from various
other sources. The following complete set of 'Questions and Answers'
recorded at the Sixth International Buddhist Synod proved to be a mine

In conclusion, I wish to put on record my deep gratitude to the
members of the Editorial Committee, Burma Pitaka Association, who had
spent long hours going through the script with meticulous care and from
whose indefatigable labour and erudite counsel this compilation has
much benefited.

Chapter I
WHAT IS VINAYA PI¿AKA?
Vinaya Pi¥aka
Disciplinary and Procedural Rules for the Saµgha
The Vinaya Pi¥aka is made up of rules of discipline laid down for
regulating the conduct of the Buddha's disciples who have been admitted
as bhikkhus and bhikkhunnøs into the Order. These rules embody
authoritative injunctions of the Buddha on modes of conduct and
restraints on both physical and verbal actions. They deal with
transgressions of discipline, and with various categories of restraints and
admonitions in accordance with the nature of the offence.
(a) Seven Kinds of Transgression or Offence, Æpatti
The rules of discipline first laid down by the Buddha are called
Mþlapaññatti (the root regulation); those supplemented later are known
as Anupaññatti. Together they are known as Sikkhæpadas, rules of
discipline. The act of transgressing these rules of discipline, thereby
incurring a penalty by the guilty bhikkhu, is called Æpatti, which means
'reaching, committing'.
The offences for which penalties are laid down may be classified
under seven categories depending on their nature:
(i) Pæræjika
(ii) Saµghædisesa
(iii) Thullaccaya
(iv) Pæcittiya
(v) Pæ¥idesanøya
(vi) Dukka¥a
(vii) Dubbhæsita.
An offence in the first category of offences, Pæræjika, is classified
as a grave offence, garukæpatti, which is irremediable, atekicchæ and
entails the falling off of the offender from bhikkhuhood.
An offence in the second category, Saµghædisesa, is also classified
as a grave offence but it is remediable, satekicchæ. The offender is put on
a probationary period of penance, during which he has to undertake
certain difficult practices and after which he is rehabilitated by the
Saµgha assembly.

22

The remaining five categories consist of light offences, lahukæpatti,
which are remediable and incur the penalty of having to confess the
transgression to another bhikkhu. After carrying out the prescribed
penalty, the bhikkhu transgressor becomes cleansed of the offence.
(b) When and how the disciplinary rules were laid down.
For twenty years after the establishment of the Order there was
neither injunction nor rule concerning Pæræjika and Saµghædisesa
offences. The members of the Order of the early days were all Ariyas, the
least advanced of whom was a Stream-winner, one who had attained the
first Magga and Fruition, and there was no need for prescribing rules
relating to grave offences.
But as the years went by, the Saµgha grew in strength.
Undesirable elements not having the purest of motives but attracted only
by the fame and gain of the bhikkhus began to get into the Buddha's
Order. Some twenty years after the founding of the Order, it became
necessary to begin establishing rules relating to grave offences.
It was through Bhikkhu Sudinna, a native of Kalanda Village near
Vesælø, who committed the offence of having sexual intercourse with his
ex-wife, that the first Pæræjika rule came to be promulgated. It was laid
down to deter bhikkhus from indulging in sexual intercourse.
When such a grave cause had arisen for which the laying down of
a prohibitory rule became necessary, the Buddha convened an assembly
of the bhikkhus. It was only after questioning the bhikkhu concerned and
after the undesirability of committing such an offence had been made
clear that a certain rule was laid down in order to prevent future lapses of
similar nature.
The Buddha also followed the precedence set by earlier Buddhas.
Using his supernormal powers, he reflected on what rules the earlier
Buddhas would lay down under certain given conditions. Then he adopted similar regulations to meet the situation that had arisen in his time.
(c) Admission of bhikkhunøs into the Order
After spending four vassas (residence period during the rains) after
his Enlightenment, the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, his native royal city,
at the request of his ailing father, King Suddhodana. At that time,
Mahæpajæpati, Buddha's foster mother, requested him to admit her into
the Order. Mahæpajæpati was not alone in desiring to join the Order. Five

23

hundred Sakyan ladies whose husbands had left the household life were
also eager to be admitted into the Order.
After his father's death, the Buddha went back to Vesælø, refusing
the repeated request of Mahæpajæpati for admission into the Order. The
determined foster mother of the Buddha and widow of the recently deceased King Suddhodana, having cut off her hair and put on bark-dyed
clothes, accompanied by five hundred Sakyan ladies, made her way to Vesælø
where the Buddha was staying in the Mahævana, in the Kþ¥ægæra Hall.
The Venerable Ænanda saw them outside the gateway of the
Kþ¥ægæra Hall, dust-laden with swollen feet, dejected, tearful, standing
and weeping. Out of great compassion for the ladies, the Venerable
Ænanda interceded with the Buddha on their behalf and entreated him to
accept them in the Order. The Buddha continued to stand firm. But when
the Venerable Ænanda asked the Buddha whether women were not
capable of attaining Magga and Phala Insight, the Buddha replied that
women were indeed capable of doing so, provided they left the household
life like their menfolk.
Thereupon Ænanda made his entreaties again saying that
Mahæpajæpati had been of great service to the Buddha waiting on him as
his guardian and nurse, suckling him when his mother died. And as
women were capable of attaining the Magga and Phala Insight, she
should be permitted to Join the Order and become a bhikkhunø.
The Buddha finally acceded to Ænanda's entreaties: "Ænanda, if
Mahæpajæpati accepts eight special rules, garu-dhammæ, let such
acceptance mean her admission to the Order."
The eight special rules1 are:
(i) A bhikkhunø, even if she enjoys a seniority of a hundred years in
the Order, must pay respect to a bhikkhu though he may have
been a bhikkhu only for a day.
(ii) A bhikkhunø must not keep her rains-residence in a place where
there are no bhikkhus.
(iii) Every fortnight a bhikkhunø must do two things: To ask the
bhikkhu Saµgha the day of uposatha, and to approach the
bhikkhu Saµgha for instruction and admonition.
(iv) When the rains-residence period is over, a bhikkhunø must attend
the paværa¼æ ceremony conducted at both the assemblies of
1

1. vide, Vinaya - II, 74-75.

24

bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs, in each of which she must invite
criticism on what has been seen, what has been heard or what has
been suspected of her.
(v) A bhikkhunø who has committed a Saµghædisesa offence must
undergo penance for a half-month, pakkha mænatta, in each
assembly of bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs.
(vi) Admission to the Order must be sought, from both assemblies, by
a woman novice only after two year's probationary training as a
candidate.
(vii) A bhikkhunø should not revile a bhikkhu in any way, not even
obliquely.
(viii) A bhikkhunø must abide by instructions given her by bhikkhus,
but must not give instructions or advice to bhikkhus.
Mahæpajæpati accepted unhesitatingly these eight conditions
imposed by the Buddha and was consequently admitted into the Order.

Chapter II
VINAYA PI¿AKA
The Vinaya Pi¥aka is made up of five books:
(1) Pæræjika Pæ¹i
(2) Pæcittiya Pæ¹i
(3) Mahævagga Pæ¹i
(4) Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i
(5) Pariværa Pæ¹i
1. Pæræjika Pæ¹i
Pæræjika Pæ¹i which is Book I of the Vinaya Pi¥aka gives an
elaborate explanation of the important rules of discipline concerning
Pæræjika and Saµghædisesa, as well as Aniyata and Nissaggiya which are
minor offences.
(a) Pæræjika offences and penalties.
Pæræjika discipline consists of four sets of rules laid down to
prevent four grave offences. Any transgressor of these rules is defeated in
his purpose in becoming a bhikkhu. In the parlance of Vinaya, the
Pæræjika Æpatti falls upon him; he automatically loses the status of a
bhikkhu; he is no longer recognized as a member of the community of
bhikkhus and is not permitted to become a bhikkhu again. He has either
to go back to the household life as a layman or revert back to the status of
a sæma¼era, a novice.
One who has lost the status of a bhikkhu for transgression of any
of these rules is likened to (i) a person whose head has been cut off from
his body; he cannot become alive even if the head is fixed back on the
body; (ii) leaves which have fallen off the branches of the tree; they will
not become green again even if they are attached back to the leaf-stalks;
(iii) a flat rock which has been split; it cannot be made whole again; (iv) a
palm tree which has been cut off from its stem; it will never grow again.
Four Pæræjika offences which lend to loss of status as a bhikkhu.
(i) The first Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should indulge in sexual
intercourse loses his bhikkhuhood.

26

(ii) The second Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should take with intention to
steal what is not given loses his bhikkhuhood.
(iii) The third Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu should intentionally deprive a
human being of life loses his bhikkhuhood.
(iv) The fourth Pæræjika: Whatever bhikkhu claims to attainments he does
not really possess, namely, attainments to jhæna or Magga and Phala
Insight loses his bhikkhuhood.
The Pæræjika offender is guilty of a very grave transgression. He
ceases to be a bhikkhu. His offence, Æpatti, is irremediable.
(b) Thirteen Saµghædisesa offences and penalties.
Saµghædisesa discipline consists of a set of thirteen rules which
require formal participation of the Saµgha from beginning to end in the
process of making him free from the guilt of transgression.
(i) A bhikkhu having transgressed these rules, and wishing to be free
from his offence must first approach the Saµgha and confess having
committed the offence. The Saµgha determines his offence and
orders him to observe the parivæsa penance, a penalty requiring him
to live under suspension from association with the rest of the Saµgha,
for as many days as he has knowingly concealed his offence.
(ii) At the end of the parivæsa observance he undergoes a further period
of penance, mænatta, for six days to gain approbation of the Saµgha.
(iii) Having carried out the mænatta penance, the bhikkhu requests the
Saµgha to reinstate him to full association with the rest of the Saµgha.
Being now convinced of the purity of his conduct as before, the
Saµgha lifts the Æpatti at a special congregation attended by at least
twenty bhikkhus, where ñatti, the motion for his reinstatement, is recited
followed by three recitals of kammavæcæ, procedural text for formal acts
of the Saµgha.
Some examples of the Saµghædisesa offences.
(i) Kæyasaµsagga offence:
If any bhikkhu with lustful, perverted thoughts engages in bodily contact
with a woman, such as holding of hands, caressing the tresses of hair or
touching any part of her body, he commits the Kæyasaµsagga
Saµghædisesa offence.

27

(ii) Sañcaritta offence:
If any bhikkhu acts as a go-between between a man and a woman for
their lawful living together as husband and wife or for temporary
arrangement as man and mistress or woman and lover, he is guilty of
Sañcaritta Saµghædisesa offence.
(c) Two Aniyata offences and penalties.
Aniyata means indefinite, uncertain. There are two Aniyata
offences the nature of which is uncertain and indefinite as to whether it is
a Pæræjika offence, a Saµghædisesa offence or a Pæcittiya offence. It is to
be determined according to provisions in the following rules:
(i) If a bhikkhu sits down privately alone with a woman in a place
which is secluded and hidden from view, and convenient for an
immoral purpose and if a trustworthy lay woman (i.e., an Ariya),
seeing him, accuses him of any one of the three offences (1) a
Pæræjika offence (2) a Saµghædisesa offence (3) a Pæcittiya offence,
and the bhikkhu himself admits that he was so sitting, he should be
found guilty of one of these three offences as accused by the
trustworthy lay woman.
(ii) If a bhikkhu sits down privately alone with a woman in a place
which is not hidden from view and not convenient for an immoral
purpose but convenient for talking lewd words to her, and if a
trustworthy lay woman (i.e., an Ariya), seeing him, accuses him of
any one of the two offences (1) a Saµghædisesa offence (2) a
Pæcittiya offence, and the bhikkhu himself admits that he was so
sitting, he should be found guilty of one of these two offences as
accused by the trustworthy lay woman.
(d) Thirty Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offences and penalties.
There are thirty rules under the Nissaggiya category of offences
and penalties which are laid down to curb inordinate greed in bhikkhus
for possession of material things such as robes, bowls etc. To give an
example, an offence is done under these rules when objects not permitted
are acquired, or when objects are acquired in more than the permitted
quantity. The penalty consists firstly of giving up the objects in respect of
which the offence has been committed. Then it is followed by confession
of the breach of the rule, together with an undertaking not to repeat the
same offence, to the Saµgha as a whole, or to a group of bhikkhus, or to
an individual bhikkhu to whom the wrongfully acquired objects have
been surrendered.

28

Some examples of the Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offences.
(i) First Nissaggiya Sikkhæpada.
If any bhikkhu keeps more than the permissible number of robes, namely,
the lower robe, the upper robe and the great robe, he commits an offence
for which he has to surrender the extra robes and confess his offence.
(ii) Cøvara Acchindana Sikkhæpada.
If any bhikkhu gives away his own robe to another bhikkhu and afterwards, being angry or displeased, takes it back forcibly or causes it to be
taken away by someone else, he commits a Nissaggiya Pæcittiya offence.
Nissaggiya offences are light offences compared with the grave
offences of Pæræjika Æpatti or Saµghædisesa Æpatti.

2. Pæcittiya Pæ¹i
The Pæcittiya Pæ¹i which is Book II of the Vinaya Pi¥aka deals with
the remaining sets of rules for the bhikkhus, namely, the Pæcittiya, the
Pæ¥idesanøya, Sekhiya, Adhikara¼asamatha and the corresponding
disciplinary rules for the bhikkhunøs. Although it is called in Pæ¹i just
Pæcittiya, it has the distinctive name of 'Suddha Pæcittiya', ordinary
Pæcittiya, to distinguish it from Nissaggiya Pæcittiya, described above.
(a) Ninety-two Pæcittiya offences and penalties.
There are ninety-two rules under this class of offences classified in
nine sections. A few examples of this type of offences:
(i) Telling a lie deliberately is a Pæcittiya offence.
(ii) A bhikkhu who sleeps under the same roof and within the walls
along with a woman commits a Pæcittiya offence.
(iii) A bhikkhu who digs the ground or causes it to be dug commits a
Pæcittiya offence.
A Pæcittiya offence is remedied merely by admission of the
offence to a bhikkhu.

29

(b) Four Pæ¥idesanøya offences and penalties.
There are four offences under this classification and they all deal
with the bhikkhu's conduct in accepting and eating alms-food offered to
him. The bhikkhu transgressing any of these rules, in making admission
of his offence, must use a special formula stating the nature of his fault.
The first rule of Pæ¥idesanøya offence reads: should a bhikkhu eat
hard food or soft food having accepted it with his own hand from a
bhikkhunø who is not his relation and who has gone among the houses for
alms-food, it should be admitted to another bhikkhu by the bhikkhu saying,
"Friend, I have done a censurable thing which is unbecoming and which
should be admitted. I admit having committed a Pætidesanøya offence."
The events that led to the laying down of the first of these rules
happened in Sævatthi, where one morning bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs were
going round for alms-food. A certain bhikkhunø offered the food she had
received to a certain bhikkhu who took away all that was in her bowl.
The bhikkhunø had to go without any food for the day. Three days in
succession she offered to give her alms-food to the same bhikkhu who on
all the three days deprived her of her entire alms-food. Consequently she
became famished. On the fourth day while going on the alms round she
fainted and fell down through weakness. When the Buddha came to hear
about this, he censured the bhikkhu who was guilty of the wrong deed
and laid down the above rule.
(c) Seventy-five Sekhiya rules of polite behaviour.
These seventy-five rules laid down originally for the proper
behaviour of bhikkhus also apply to novices who seek admission to the
Order. Most of these rules were all laid down at Sævatthi on account of
indisciplined behaviour on the part of a group of six bhikkhus. The rules
can be divided into four groups. The first group of twenty-six rules is
concerned with good conduct and behaviour when going into towns and
villages. The second group of thirty rules deals with polite manners when
accepting alms-food and when eating meals. The third group of sixteen
rules contains rules which prohibit teaching of the Dhamma to
disrespectful people. The fourth group of three rules relates to
unbecoming ways of answering the calls of nature and of spitting.
(d) Seven ways of settling disputes, Adhikara¼asamatha.
Pæcittiya Pæ¹i concludes the disciplinary rules for bhikkhus with a
Chapter on seven ways of settling cases, Adhikara¼asamatha.

30

Four kinds of cases are listed:
(i) Vivædædhikara¼a — Disputes as to what is dhamma, what is not
dhamma; what is Vinaya, what is not Vinaya; what the Buddha said,
what the Buddha did not say; and what constitutes an offence, what
is not an offence.
(ii) Anuvædædhikara¼a — Accusations and disputes arising out of them
concerning the virtue, practice, views and way of living of a bhikkhu.
(iii) Æpattædhikara¼a — Infringement of any disciplinary rule.
(iv) Kiccædhikara¼a — Formal meeting or decisions made by the Saµgha.
For settlement of such disputes that may arise from time to time
amongst the Order, precise and detailed methods are prescribed under
seven heads:
(i) Sammukhæ Vinaya — before coming to a decision, conducting an
enquiry in the presence of both parties in accordance with the rules
of Vinaya.
(ii) Sati Vinaya — making a declaration by the Saµgha of the innocence
of an Arahat against whom some allegations have been made, after
asking him if he remembers having committed the offence.
(iii) Amþ¹ha Vinaya — making a declaration by the Saµgha when the
accused is found to be insane.
(iv) Patiññæta Kara¼a — making a decision after admission by the party
concerned.
(v) Yebhuyyasika Kamma — making a decision in accordance with the
majority vote.
(vi) Tassapæpiyasika Kamma — making a declaration by the Saµgha
when the accused proves to be unreliable, making admissions only to
retract them, evading questions and telling lies.
(vii)Ti¼avatthæraka Kamma —‘'the act of covering up with grass'’ ——
exonerating all offences except the offences of Pæræjika,
Saµghædisesa and those in connection with laymen and laywomen,
when the disputing parties are made to reconcile by the Saµgha.
(e) Rules of Discipline for the bhikkhunøs.
The concluding chapters in the Pæcittiya Pæ¹i are devoted to the
rules of Discipline for the bhikkhunøs. The list of rules for bhikkhunøs
runs longer than that for the bhikkhus. The bhikkhunø rules were drawn

31

up on exactly the same lines as those for the bhikkhus, with the exception
of the two Aniyata rules which are not laid down for the bhikkhunø Order.

(1) Pæræjika
(2) Saµghædisesa
(3) Aniyata
(4) Nissaggiya Pæcittiya
(5) Suddha Pæcittiya
(6) Pæ¥idesanøya

These eight categories of disciplinary rules for bhikkhus and
bhikkhunøs of the Order are treated in detail in the first two books of the
Vinaya Pi¥aka. For each rule an historical account is given as to how it
comes to be laid down, followed by an exhortation of the Buddha ending
with "This offence does not lead to rousing of faith in those who are not
convinced of the Teaching, nor to increase of faith in those who are
convinced." After the exhortation comes the particular rule laid down by
the Buddha followed by word for word commentary on the rule.

3. Mahævagga Pæ¹i.
The next two books, namely, Mahævagga Pæ¹i which is Book III
and Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i which is Book IV of the Vinaya Pi¥aka, deal with all
those matters relating to the Saµgha which have not been dealt with in
the first two books.
Mahævagga Pæ¹i, made up of ten sections known as Khandhakas,
opens with an historical account of how the Buddha attained Supreme
Enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi Tree, how he discovered the
famous law of Dependent Origination, how he gave his first sermon to
the Group of Five Bhikkhus on the discovery of the Four Noble Truths,
namely, the great Discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma,

32

Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. This was followed by another great
discourse, the Anattalakkha¼a Sutta. These two suttas may be described
as the Compendium of the Teaching of the Buddha.
The first section continues to describe how young men of good
families like Yasa sought refuge in him as a Buddha and embraced his
Teaching; how the Buddha embarked upon the unique mission of
spreading the Dhamma 'for the welfare and happiness of the many' when
he had collected round him sixty disciples who were well established in
the Dhamma and had become Arahats; how he began to establish the
Order of the Saµgha to serve as a living example of the Truth he
preached; and how his famous disciples like Særiputta, Moggallæna,
Mahæ Kassapa, Ænanda, Upæli, A³gulimæla became members of the
Order. The same section then deals with the rules for formal admission to
the Order, (Upasampadæ), giving precise conditions to be fulfilled before
any person can gain admission to the Order and the procedure to be
followed for each admission.
Mahævagga further deals with procedures for an Uposatha
meeting, the assembly of the Saµgha on every full moon day and on the
fourteenth or fifteenth waning day of the lunar month when Pætimokkha,
a summary of the Vinaya rules, is recited. Then there are rules to be
observed for rains retreat (vassa) during the rainy season as well as those
for the formal ceremony of paværa¼æ concluding the rains retreat, in
which a bhikkhu invites criticism from his brethren in respect of what has
been seen, heard or suspected about his conduct.
There are also rules concerning sick bhikkhus, the use of leather
for footwear and furniture, materials for robes, and those concerning
medicine and food. A separate section deals with the Kathina ceremonies
where annual making and offering of robes take place.

4. Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i
Cþ¹avagga Pæ¹i which is Book IV of the Vinaya Pi¥aka continues to
deal with more rules and procedures for institutional acts or functions
known as Saµghakamma. The twelve sections in this book deal with
rules for offences such as Saµghædisesa that come before the Saµgha;
rules for observance of penances such as parivæsa and mænatta and rules
for reinstatement of a bhikkhu. There are also miscellaneous rules
concerning bathing, dress, dwellings and furniture and those dealing with
treatment of visiting bhikkhus, and duties of tutors and novices. Some of

33

the important enactments are concerned with Tajjanøya Kamma, formal
act of censure by the Saµgha taken against those bhikkhus who cause
strife, quarrels, disputes, who associate familiarly with lay people and
who speak in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha;
Ukkhepanøya Kamma, formal act of suspension to be taken against those
who having committed an offence do not want to admit it; and
Pakæsanøya Kamma taken against Devadatta announcing publicly that
"Whatever Devadatta does by deed or word, should be seen as
Devadatta's own and has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Saµgha." The account of this action is followed by the story of
Devadatta's three attempts on the life of the Buddha and the schism
caused by Devadatta among the Saµgha.
There is, in section ten, the story of how Mahæpajæpati, the
Buddha's foster mother, requested admission into the Order, how the
Buddha refused permission at first, and how he finally acceded to the
request because of Ænanda's entreaties on her behalf.
The last two sections describe two important events of historical
interest, namely, the holding of the first Synod at Ræjagaha and of the
second Synod at Vesælø.

5. Pariværa Pæ¹i
Pariværa Pæ¹i which is Book V and the last book of the Vinaya
Pi¥aka serves as a kind of manual. It is compiled in the form of a
catechism, enabling the reader to make an analytical survey of the Vinaya
Pi¥aka. All the rules, official acts, and other matters of the Vinaya are
classified under separate categories according to subjects dealt with.
Pariværa explains how rules of the Order are drawn up to regulate
the conduct of the bhikkhus as well as the administrative affairs of the
Order. Precise procedures are prescribed for settling of disputes and
handling matters of jurisprudence, for formation of Saµgha courts and
appointment of well-qualified Saµgha judges. It lays down how Saµgha
Vinicchaya Committee, the Saµgha court, is to be constituted with a
body of learned Vinayadharas, experts in Vinaya rules, to hear and decide
all kinds of monastic disputes.
The Pariværa Pæ¹i provides general principles and guidance in the
spirit of which all the Saµgha Vinicchaya proceedings are to be
conducted for settlement of monastic disputes.

34

Chapter III
WHAT IS SUTTANTA PI¿AKA?
The Suttanta Pi¥aka is a collection of all the discourses in their
entirety delivered by the Buddha on various occasions. (A few discourses
delivered by some of the distinguished disciples of the Buddha, such as
the Venerable Særiputta, Mahæ Moggallæna, Ænanda, etc., as well as
some narratives are also included in the books of the Suttanta Pi¥aka.)
The discourses of the Buddha compiled together in the Suttanta Pi¥aka
were expounded to suit different occasions, for various persons with
different temperaments. Although the discourses were mostly intended
for the benefit of bhikkhus, and deal with the practice of the pure life and
with the exposition of the Teaching, there are also several other discourses which deal with the material and moral progress of the lay disciples.
The Suttanta Pi¥aka brings out the meaning of the Buddha's
teachings, expresses them clearly, protects and guards them against
distortion and misconstruction. Just like a string which serves as a plumbline to guide the carpenters in their work, just like a thread which protects
flowers from being scattered or dispersed when strung together by it,
likewise by means of suttas, the meaning of Buddha's teachings may be
brought out clearly, grasped and understood correctly and given perfect
protection from being misconstrued.
The Suttanta Pi¥aka is divided into five separate collections known
as Nikæyas. They are Døgha Nikæya, Majjhima Nikæya, Saµyutta Nikæya,
A³guttara Nikæya and Khuddaka Nikæya.
(a) Observances and Practices in the Teaching of the Buddha.
In the Suttanta Pi¥aka are found not only the fundamentals of the
Dhamma but also pragmatic guidelines to make the Dhamma meaningful
and applicable to daily life. All observances and practices which form
practical steps in the Buddha's Noble Path of Eight Constituents lead to
spiritual purification at three levels:
Søla
— moral purity through right conduct,
Samædhi
— purity of mind through concentration (Samatha),
Paññæ
— purity of Insight through Vipassanæ Meditation.

35

To begin with, one must make the right resolution to take refuge in
the Buddha, to follow the Buddha's Teaching, and to be guided by the
Saµgha. The first disciples who made the declaration of faith in the
Buddha and committed themselves to follow his Teaching were the two
merchant brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika. They were travelling with their
followers in five hundred carts when they saw the Buddha in the vicinity
of the Bodhi Tree after his Enlightenment. The two merchants offered
him honey rice cakes. Accepting their offering and thus breaking the fast
he had imposed on himself for seven weeks, the Buddha made them his
disciples by letting them recite after him:
"Buddhaµ Saranaµ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Buddha)."
"Dhammaµ Saranaµ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Dhammæ)."
This recitation became the formula of declaration of faith in the
Buddha and his Teaching. Later when the Saµgha became established,
the formula was extended to include the third commitment:
"Saµghaµ Saranaµ Gacchæmi (I take refuge in the Saµgha)."
(b) On the right way to give alms.
As a practical step, capable of immediate and fruitful use by
people in all walks of life, the Buddha gave discourses on charity, almsgiving, explaining its virtues and on the right way and the right attitude of
mind with which an offering is to be made for spiritual uplift.
The motivating force in an act of charity is the volition, the will to
give. Charity is a meritorious action that arises only out of volition.
Without the will to give, there is no act of giving. Volition in giving alms
is of three types:
(i) The volition that starts with the thought 'I shall make an offering'
and that exists during the period of preparations for making the
offering — Pubba Cetanæ, volition before the act.
(ii) The volition that arises at the moment of making the offering while
handing it over to the donee — Muñca Cetanæ, volition during the act.
(iii) The volition accompanying the joy and rejoicing which arise during
repeated recollection of or reflection on the act of giving — Apara
Cetanæ, volition after the act.

36

Whether the offering is made in homage to the living Buddha or to
a minute particle of his relics after his passing away, it is the volition, its
strength and purity that determine the nature of the result thereof.
There is also explained in the discourses the wrong attitude of
mind with which no act of charity should be performed.
A donor should avoid looking down on others who cannot make a
similar offering; nor should he exult over his own charity. Defiled by
such unworthy thoughts, his volition is only of inferior grade.
When the act of charity is motivated by expectations of beneficial
results of immediate prosperity and happiness, or rebirth in higher
existences, the accompanying volition is classed as mediocre.
It is only when the good deed of alms-giving is performed out of a
spirit of renunciation, motivated by thoughts of pure selflessness, aspiring
only for attainment to Nibbæna where all suffering ends, that the volition
that brings about the act is regarded as of superior grade.
Examples abound in the discourses concerning charity and modes
of giving alms.
(c) Moral Purity through right conduct, Søla.
Practice of Søla forms a most fundamental aspect of Buddhism. It
consists of practice of Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihood
to purge oneself of impure deeds, words and thoughts. Together with the
commitment to the Threefold Refuge (as described above) a Buddhist lay
disciple observes the Five Precepts by making a formal vow:
(i) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from killing.
(ii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from stealing.
(iii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from sexual
misconduct.
(iv) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from telling lies.
(v) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from alcoholic
drinks, drugs or intoxicants that becloud the mind.
In addition to the negative aspect of the above formula which
emphasizes abstinence, there is also the positive aspect of Søla. For
instance, we find in many discourses the statement: 'He refrains from
killing, puts aside the cudgel and the sword; full of kindness and

37

compassion he lives for the welfare and happiness of all living things.'
Every precept laid down in the formula has these two aspects.
Depending upon the individual and the stage of one's progress,
other forms of precepts, namely, Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts etc. may be
observed. For the bhikkhus of the Order, higher and advanced types of
practices of morality are laid down. The Five Precepts are to be always
observed by lay disciples who may occasionally enhance their selfdiscipline by observing the Eight or Ten Precepts. For those who have
already embarked on the path of a holy life, the Ten Precepts are essential
preliminaries to further progress.
Søla of perfect purity serves as a foundation for the next stage of
progress, namely, Samædhi purity of mind through concentrationmeditation.
(d) Practical methods of mental cultivation for development of
concentration, samædhi.
Mental cultivation for spiritual uplift consists of two steps. The
first step is to purify the mind from all defilements and corruption and to
have it focused on a point. A determined effort (Right Exertion) must be
made to narrow down the range of thoughts in the wavering, unsteady
mind. Then attention (Right Mindfulness or Attentiveness) must be fixed
on a selected object of meditation until one-pointedness of mind (Right
Concentration) is achieved. In such a state, the mind becomes freed from
hindrances, pure, tranquil, powerful and bright. It is then ready to
advance to the second step by which Magga Insight and Fruition may be
attained in order to transcend the state of woe and sorrow.
The Suttanta Pi¥aka records numerous methods of meditation to
bring about one-pointedness of mind. In the Suttas of the Pi¥aka are
dispersed these methods of meditation, explained by the Buddha
sometimes singly, sometimes collectively to suit the occasion and the
purpose for which they are recommended. The Buddha knew the
diversity of character and mental make-up of each individual, the
different temperaments and inclinations of those who approached him for
guidance. Accordingly he recommended different methods to different
persons to suit the special character and need of each individual.
The practice of mental cultivation which results ultimately in onepointedness of mind is known as Samædhi Bhævanæ. Whoever wishes to
develop Samædhi Bhævanæ must have been established in the observance
of the precepts, with the senses controlled, calm and self-possessed, and

38

must be contented. Having been established in these four conditions he
selects a place suitable for meditation, a secluded spot. Then he should sit
cross-legged keeping his body erect and his mind alert; he should start
purifying his mind of five hindrances, namely, sensual desire, ill will,
sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt, by choosing a
meditation method suitable to him, practicing meditation with zeal and
ardour. For instance, with the Ænæpæna method he keeps watching the
incoming and outgoing breath until he can have his mind fixed securely
on the breath at the tip of the nose.
When he realizes that the five hindrances have been got rid of, he
becomes gladdened, delighted, calm and blissful. This is the beginning of
samædhi, concentration, which will further develop until it attains onepointedness of mind.
Thus one-pointedness of mind is concentration of mind when it is
aware of one object, and only one of a wholesome, salutary nature. This
is attained by the practice of meditation upon one of the subjects
recommended for the purpose by the Buddha.
(e) Practical methods of mental cultivation for development of Insight
Knowledge, paññæ.
The subject and methods of meditation as taught in the suttas of the
Pi¥aka are designed both for attainment of samædhi as well as for development of Insight Knowledge, Vipassanæ Ñæ¼a, as a direct path to Nibbæna.
As a second step in the practice of meditation, after achieving
samædhi, when the concentrated mind has become purified, firm and
imperturbable, the meditator directs and inclines his mind to Insight
Knowledge, Vipassanæ Ñæ¼a. With this Insight Knowledge he discerns
the three characteristics of the phenomenal world, namely,
Impermanence (Anicca), Suffering (Dukkha) and Non-Self (Anatta).
As he advances in his practice and his mind becomes more and
more purified, firm and imperturbable, he directs and inclines his mind to
the knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants, Æsavakkhaya Ñæ¼a.
He then truly understands dukkha, the cause of dukkha, the cessation of
dukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha. He also comes to
understand fully the moral intoxicants (æsavas) as they really are, the
cause of æsavas, the cessation of æsavas and the path leading to the
cessation of the æsavas.

39

With this knowledge of extinction of æsavas he becomes liberated.
The knowledge of liberation arises in him. He knows that rebirth is no
more, that he has lived the holy life; he has done what he has to do for the
realization of Magga; there is nothing more for him to do for such
realization.
The Buddha taught with only one object — the extinction of
Suffering and release from conditioned existence. That object is to be
obtained by the practice of meditation (for Calm and Insight) as laid
down in numerous suttas of the Suttanta Pi¥aka.

Chapter IV
SUTTANTA PI¿AKA
Døgha Nikæya
Collection of Long Discourses of the Buddha
This Collection in the Suttanta Pi¥aka, named Døgha Nikæya as it
is made up of thirty-four long discourses of the Buddha, is divided into
three divisions: (a) Sølakkhandha Vagga, Division Concerning Morality
(b) Mahæ Vagga, the Large Division (c) Pæthika Vagga, the Division
beginning with the discourse on Pæthika, the Naked Ascetic.
(a) Sølakkhandha Vagga Pæ¹i
Division Concerning Morality
This division contains thirteen suttas which deal extensively with
various types of morality, namely, Minor Morality, basic morality
applicable to all; Middle Morality and Major Morality which are mostly
practised by Sama¼as and Bræhma¼as. It also discusses the wrong views
then prevalent as well as brahmin views of sacrifice and caste, and
various religious practices such as extreme self-mortification.
(1) Brahmajæla Sutta, Discourse on the Net of Perfect Wisdom.
An argument between Suppiya, a wandering ascetic, and his pupil
Brahmadatta, with the teacher maligning the Buddha, the Dhamma and
the Saµgha and the pupil praising the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha,
gave rise to this famous discourse which is listed first in this Nikæya.
In connection with the maligning of the Buddha, the Dhamma and
the Saµgha, the Buddha enjoined his disciples not to feel resentment, nor
displeasure nor anger, because it would only be spiritually harmful to
them. As to the words of praise for the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
Saµgha, the Buddha advised his disciples not to feel pleased, delighted
or elated, for it would be an obstacle to their progress in the Path.
The Buddha said that whatever worldling, puthujjana, praised the
Buddha he could not do full justice to the peerless virtues of the Buddha,
namely, his Superior Concentration, samædhi, and Wisdom, paññæ. A
worldling could touch on only "matters of a trifling and inferior nature,
mere morality." The Buddha explained the three grades of morality and

41

said there were other dhammas profound, hard to see, subtle and
intelligible only to the wise. Anyone wishing to praise correctly the true
virtues of the Buddha should do so only in terms of these dhammas.
Then the Buddha continued to expound on various wrong views.
There were sama¼as and bræhma¼as who, speculating on the past,
adhered to and asserted their wrong views in eighteen different ways,
namely:
(i) Four Kinds of Belief in Eternity, Sassata Di¥¥hi,
(ii) Four Kinds of Dualistic belief in Eternity and Non-eternity, Ekacca
Sassata Di¥¥hi,
(iii) Four Views of the World being Finite or Infinite, Antænanta Di¥¥hi,
(iv) Four Kinds of ambiguous evasion, Amarævikkhepa Væda,
(v) Two Doctrines of Non-Causality, Adhiccasamuppanna Væda.
There were sama¼as and bræhma¼as, who, speculating on the
future, adhered to and asserted their wrong views in forty-four ways,
namely:
(i) Sixteen Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Saññæ after death,
Uddhæmæghætanika Saññø Væda,
(ii) Eight Kinds of Belief in the Non-Existence of Saññæ after death,
Uddhamæghætanika Asaññø Væda,
(iii)Eight Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Neither Saññæ Nor Nonsaññæ after death, Uddhamæghætanika Nevasaññø Næsaññø Væda,
(iv)Seven Kinds of Belief in Annihilation, Uccheda Væda,
(v) Five Kinds of Mundane Nibbæna as realizable in this very life,
Di¥¥hadhamma Nibbæna Væda.
The Buddha said that whatever sama¼as and bræhma¼as
speculated on the past, or the future or both the past and the future, they
did so in these sixty-two ways or one of these sixty-two ways.
The Buddha announced further that he knew all these wrong
views and also what would be the destination, the next existence, in
which the one holding these views would be reborn.
The Buddha gave a detailed analysis of these wrong views
asserted in sixty-two ways and pointed out that these views had their
origin in feeling which arose as a result of repeated contact through the
six sense bases. Whatever person holds these wrong views, in him feeling
gives rise to craving; craving gives rise to clinging; clinging gives rise to

42

existence; the kammic causal process in existence gives rise to rebirth;
and rebirth gives rise to ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress
and despair.
But whatever person knows, as they really are, the origin of the
six sense bases of contact, their cessation, their pleasurableness, their
danger and the way of escape from them, he realizes the dhammas, not
only mere morality, søla, but also concentration, samædhi, and liberation,
vimutti, wisdom, paññæ, that transcend all these wrong views.
All the sama¼as and bræhma¼as holding the sixty-two categories
of wrong views are caught in the net of this discourse just like all the fish
in a lake are contained in a finely meshed net spread by a skilful
fisherman or his apprentice.
(2) Sæmaññaphala Sutta, Discourse on the Fruits of the Life of a Sama¼a
On one full moon night while the Buddha was residing in
Ræjagaha at the mango grove of Jøvaka this discourse on the fruits of the
life of a sama¼a, personally experienced in this very life, was taught to
King Ajætasattu on request by him. The Buddha explained to him the
advantage of the life of a sama¼a by giving him the examples of a servant
of his household or a landholder cultivating the King's own land
becoming a sama¼a to whom the King himself would show respect and
make offerings of requisites, providing him protection and security at the
same time.
The Buddha provided further elucidation on other advantages,
higher and better, of being a sama¼a by elaborating on (i) how a
householder, hearing the dhamma taught by a Buddha, leaves the home
life and becomes a sama¼a out of pure faith; (ii) how he becomes
established in three categories of Søla, minor, middle and major; (iii) how
he gains control over his sense-faculties so that no depraved states of
mind as covetousness and dissatisfaction would overpower him; (iv) how
he becomes endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension and
remains contented; (v) how, by dissociating himself from five hindrances,
he achieves the four jhænas — the first, the second, the third and the
fourth — as higher advantages than those previously mentioned; (vi) how
he becomes equipped with eight kinds of higher knowledge, namely,
Insight Knowledge, the Power of Creation by Mind, the Psychic Powers,
the Divine Power of Hearing, Knowledge of the Minds of others,
Knowledge of Past Existences, Divine Power of Sight, Knowledge of
Extinction of moral intoxicants.

43

Thus when the knowledge of liberation arises in him, he knows he
has lived the life of purity. There is no other advantage of being a
sama¼a, personally experienced, more pleasing and higher than this.
(3) Amba¥¥ha Sutta.
Amba¥¥ha, a young disciple of Pokkharasæti, the learned brahmin,
was sent by his master to investigate whether Gotama was a genuine
Buddha endowed with thirty-two personal characteristics of a great man.
His insolent behaviour, taking pride in his birth as a brahmin, led the
Buddha to subdue him by proving that Khattiya is in fact superior to
Bræhma¼a. The Buddha explained further that nobleness in man stemmed
not from birth but from perfection in three categories of morality,
achievements of four jhænas, and accomplishments in eight kinds of
higher knowledge.
(4) So¼adanda Sutta.
This discourse was given to the brahmin So¼adanda who
approached the Buddha while he was residing near Lake Gaggaræ at
Campæ in the country of A³ga. He was asked by the Buddha what
attributes one should possess to be acknowledged as a brahmin.
So¼adanda enumerated high birth, learning in the Vedas, good
personality, morality and knowledge as essential qualities to be a
brahmin. When further questioned by the Buddha, he said that the
minimum qualifications were morality and knowledge without which no
one would be entitled to be called a brahmin. On his request, the Buddha
explained to him the meaning of the terms morality and knowledge,
which he confessed to be ignorant of, namely, the three categories of
morality, achievements of four jhænas and accomplishments in eight
kinds of higher knowledge.
(5) Kþ¥adanta Sutta
On the eve of offering a great sacrificial feast, the brahmin
Kþ¥adanta went to see the Buddha for advice on how best to conduct the
sacrifice. Giving the example of a former King Mahævijita, who also
made a great sacrificial offering, the Buddha declared the principle of
consent by four parties from the provinces, namely, noblemen, ministers,
rich brahmins and householders; the eight qualities to be possessed by the
king who would make the offerings; the four qualities of the brahmin

44

royal adviser who would conduct the ceremonies and the three attitudes
of mind towards the sacrifices. With all these conditions fulfilled, the
feast offered by the king was a great success, with no loss of life of
sacrificial animals, no hardship on the people, no one impressed into
service, every one co-operating in the great feast willingly.
The brahmin Kþ¥adanta then asked the Buddha if there was any
sacrifice which could be made with less trouble and exertion, yet
producing more fruitful result. The Buddha told him of the traditional
practice of offering the four requisites to bhikkhus of high morality. Less
troublesome and more profitable again was donating a monastery to the
Order of Bhikkhus. Better still were the following practices in ascending
order of beneficial effects: (i) going to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Saµgha for refuge; (ii) observance of the Five Precepts; (iii) going forth
from the home life and leading the holy life, becoming established in
morality, accomplished in the four jhænas, and equipped with eight kinds
of higher knowledge resulting in the realization of extinction of æsavas,
the sacrifice which entails less trouble and exertion but which excels all
other sacrifices.
(6) Mahæli Sutta
Mahæli O¥¥haddha, a Licchavø ruler, once came to see the Buddha
to whom he recounted what Sunakkhatta, a Licchavø prince, had told him.
Sunakkhatta had been a disciple of the Buddha for three years after which
he left the Teaching. He told Mahæli how he had acquired the Divine
Power of Sight by which he had seen myriads of pleasant, desirable forms
belonging to the deva world but that he had not heard sounds belonging to
the deva world. Mahæli wanted to know from the Buddha whether
Sunakkhatta did not hear the sounds of the deva world because they were
non-existent, or whether he did not hear them although they existed.
The Buddha explained that there were sounds in the deva world
but Sunakkhatta did not hear them because he had developed
concentration only for one purpose, to achieve the Divine Power of Sight
but not the Divine Power of Hearing.
The Buddha explained further that his disciples practiced the
noble life under him not to acquire such divine powers but with a view to
the realization of dhammas which far excel and transcend these mundane
kinds of concentrations. Such dhammas are attainments of the Four States
of Noble Fruition — states of a stream-winner, a once-returner, a non-

45

returner, and the state of mind and knowledge of an Arahat freed of all
æsavas that have been rendered extinct.
The Path by which these dhammas can be realized is the Noble
Path of Eight Constituents: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech,
Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right
Concentration.
(7) Jæliya Sutta
Once when the Buddha was residing at Ghositæræma Monastery
near Kosambø, two wandering ascetics Mu¼ðiya and Jæliya approached him
and asked whether the soul was the physical body, or the physical body the
soul, or whether the soul was one thing and the physical body another.
The Buddha explained how a person who had finally realized
liberation would not even consider whether the soul was the physical
body, or the physical body the soul or whether the soul was one thing and
the physical body another.
(8) Mæhasøhanæda Sutta
This discourse defines what a true sama¼a is, what a true
bræmna¼a is. The Buddha was residing in the Deer Park of Ka¼¼akathala
at Uruññæ. Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached him and said that
he had heard that Sama¼a Gotama disparaged all practices of selfmortification and that Sama¼a Gotama reviled all those who led an
austere life.
The Buddha replied that they were slandering him with what was
not said, what was not true. When the Buddha could see with his
supernormal vision the bad destinies as well as the good destinies of
those who practiced extreme forms of self-mortification, and of those
who practiced less extreme forms of self-mortification, how could he
revile all systems of self-mortification?
Kassapa then maintained that only those recluses who for the
whole of their life cultivated the practice of standing or sitting, who were
abstemious in food, eating only once in two days, seven days, fifteen
days etc., were real sama¼as and bræhma¼as. The Buddha explained to
him the futility of extreme self-mortification and said that only when a
recluse practiced to become accomplished in morality, concentration and
knowledge; cultivated loving-kindness, and dwelt in the emancipation of
mind, and emancipation through knowledge that he would be entitled to

46

be called a sama¼a and bræhma¼a. Then the Buddha gave full exposition
on morality, concentration and knowledge, resulting in Kassapa's
decision to join the Order of the Buddha.
(9) Po¥¥hapæda Sutta
Once when the Buddha was staying at the Monastery of
Anæthæpi¼ðika in the Jeta Grove at Sævatthi he visited the Ekasælaka Hall
where various views were debated. At that time Po¥¥hapæda the wandering
ascetic asked him about the nature of the cessation of Consciousness
(saññæ). Po¥¥hapæda wanted to know how the cessation of Consciousness
was brought about. The Buddha told him that it was through reason and
cause that forms of Consciousness in a being arose and ceased. A certain
form of Consciousness arose through practice (Adhicitta sikkhæ) and a
certain form of Consciousness ceased through practice.
The Buddha then proceeded to expound on these practices
consisting of observance of søla and development of concentration which
resulted in arising and ceasing of successive jhænas. The meditator
progressed from one stage to the next in sequence until he achieved the
Cessation of all forms of Consciousness (nirodha samæpatti).
(10) Subha Sutta
This is a discourse given not by the Buddha but by his close
attendant, the Venerable Ænanda, on the request of young Subha. The
Buddha had passed away by then. And young Subha wanted to know from
the lips of the Buddha's close attendant what dhammas were praised by the
Buddha and what those dhammas were which he urged people to practise.
Ænanda told him that the Buddha had words of praise for the three
aggregates of dhamma, namely, the aggregate of morality, the aggregate of
concentration and the aggregate of knowledge. The Buddha urged people
to practice these dhammas, dwell in them, and have them firmly established. Ænanda explained these aggregates of dhamma in great detail to
young Subha, in consequence of which he became a devoted lay disciple.
(11) Keva¥¥a Sutta
The Buddha was residing at Næ¹andæ in Pæværika's mango grove.
A devoted lay disciple approached the Buddha and urged him to let one

47

of his disciples perform miracles so that the City of Næ¹andæ would
become ever so much devoted to the Buddha.
The Buddha told him about the three kinds of miracles which he
had known and realized by himself through supernormal knowledge. The
first miracle, iddhi pæ¥ihæriya, was rejected by the Buddha because it
could be mistaken as the black art called Gandhærø magic. The Buddha
also rejected the second miracle, ædesanæ pæ¥ihæriya which might be
mistaken as practice of Cintæmani charm. He recommended the
performance of the third miracle, the anusænsanø pæ¥ihæriya, the miracle
of the power of the Teaching as it involved practice in Morality,
Concentration and Knowledge leading finally to the Extinction of
Æsavas, Æsavakkhaya Ñæ¼a.
(12) Lohicca Sutta
The discourse lays down three types of blameworthy teachers:
(i) The teacher who is not yet accomplished in the noble practice and
teaches pupils who do not listen to him. (ii) The teacher who is not yet
accomplished in the noble practice and teaches pupils who practice as
instructed by him and attain emancipation. (iii) The teacher who is fully
accomplished in the noble practice and teaches pupils who do not listen
to him.
The praiseworthy teacher is one who has become fully
accomplished in the three practices of Morality, Concentration and
Knowledge and teaches pupils who become fully accomplished like him.
(13) Tevijja Sutta
Two brahmin youths Væse¥¥ha and Bhæradvæja came to see the
Buddha while he was on a tour through the Kingdom of Kosala. They
wanted the Buddha to settle their dispute as to the correct path that led
straight to companionship with the Brahmæ. Each one thought only the
way shown by his own master was the true one.
The Buddha told them that as none of their masters had seen the
Brahmæ, they were like a line of blind men each holding on to the
preceding one. Then he showed them the true path that really led to the
Brahma realm, namely, the path of morality and concentration, and
development of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and
equanimity towards all sentient beings.

48

(b) Mahæ Vagga Pæ¹i
The Large Division
The ten suttas in this division are some of the most important ones
of the Tipi¥aka, dealing with historical, and biographical aspects as well
as the doctrinal aspects of Buddhism. The most famous sutta is the
Mahæparinibbæna Sutta which gives an account of the last days and the
passing away of the Buddha and the distribution of his relics.
Mahæpadæna Sutta deals with brief accounts of the last seven Buddhas
and the life story of the Vipassø Buddha. Doctrinally important are the
two suttas: the Mahænidæna Sutta which explains the Chain of Cause and
Effect, and the Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta dealing with the four Methods of
Steadfast Mindfulness and practical aspects of Buddhist meditation.
(1) Mahæpadæna Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi to the bhikkhus who were
one day discussing the Buddha's knowledge of past existences. He told
them about the last seven Buddhas, with a full life story of one of them,
the Vipassø Buddha, recalling all the facts of the Buddhas, their social
rank, name, clan, life-span, the pairs of Chief Disciples, the assemblies of
their followers, their attainments, and emancipation from defilements.
The Buddha explained that his ability to remember and recall all
the facts of past existences was due to his own penetrating discernment as
well as due to the devas making these matters known to him.
(2) Mahænidæna Sutta
This discourse was given at Kammæsadhamma market town to the
Venerable Ænanda to correct his wrong view that the doctrine of
Pa¥iccasamuppæda, although having signs of being deep and profound,
was apparent and fathomable. The Buddha told him that this doctrine not
only appeared to be deep and profound but was actually deep and
profound on four counts: it was deep in meaning, deep as a doctrine, deep
with respect to the manner in which it was taught, and deep with regard
to the facts on which it was established.
He then gave a thorough exposition on the doctrine and said that
because of lack of proper understanding and penetrative comprehension
of this doctrine, beings were caught in and unable to escape from, the
miserable, ruinous round of rebirth. He concluded that without a clear

49

understanding of this doctrine, even the mind of those, accomplished in
the attainments of jhæna, would be beclouded with ideas of atta.
(3) Mahæparinibbæna Sutta
This sutta is an important narrative of the Buddha's last days, a
detailed chronicle of what he did, what he said and what happened to him
during the last year of his life. Compiled in a narrative form, it is
interspersed with many discourses on some of the most fundamental and
important aspects of the Buddha's Teaching. Being the longest discourse
of the Døgha Nikæya, it is divided into six chapters.
On the eve of the last great tour, the Buddha while staying at
Ræjagaha gave the famous discourses on seven factors of Non-decline of
kings and princes and seven factors of Non-decline of the bhikkhus.
Then he set out on his last journey going first to the village of
Pæ¥ali where he taught on the consequences of an immoral and a moral
life. He then proceeded to the village of Ko¥i where he expounded on the
Four Noble Truths. Then the Buddha took up his residence at the village
of Nætika where the famous discourse on the Mirror of Truth was given.
Next the Buddha went to Vesælø with a large company of
bhikkhus. At Vesælø he accepted the park offered by the Courtesan
Ambapæ¹ø. From Vesælø, the Buddha travelled to a small village named
Ve¹uva where he was overtaken by a severe illness that could have
proved fatal. But the Buddha resolved to maintain the life-process and
not to pass away without addressing his lay disciples and without taking
leave of the Saµgha. When Ænanda informed the Buddha how worried
he had been because of the Buddha's illness, the Buddha gave the famous
injunction: "Let yourselves be your own support, your own refuge. Let
the Dhamma, not anything else, be your refuge."
It was at Vesælø that the Buddha made the decision to pass away
and realize parinibbæna in three months' time. Upon his making this
momentous decision, there was great earthquake. Ænanda, on learning
from the Buddha the reason of the earthquake, supplicated him to change
the decision, but to no avail.
The Buddha then caused the Saµgha to be assembled to whom he
announced his approaching parinibbæna. He then went over all the fundamental principles of his Teaching and exhorted them to be vigilant, alert,
and to watch over one's own mind so as to make an end of suffering.

50

The Buddha then left Vesælø and went to Bhanða Village where
he continued to give his discourses to the accompanying Saµgha on søla,
samædhi and paññæ. Proceeding further on his journey to the north, he
gave the discourse on the four great Authorities, Mahæpadesa, at the town
of Bhoga.
From there he went on to Pævæ and stayed in the Mango Grove of
Cunda, the Goldsmith's son, who made an offering of food to the Buddha
and his community of bhikkhus. After eating the meal offered by Cunda,
a severe illness came upon the Buddha who nevertheless continued on his
journey till he reached Kusinæræ where in the Sal Grove of the Malla
princes he urged Ænanda to lay out the couch for him. He lay down on
the couch with mindfulness and deliberation, awaiting the hour of his
parinibbæna.
Even on his death-bed the Buddha continued to teach, explaining
that there are four places which arouse reverence and devotion, four
persons worthy of a stupa, and answering Ænanda's questions on how to
conduct oneself with regard to women, or on what should be done
regarding the remains of the Buddha. His last act of selflessness was to
expound the Truth and show the Path to Subhadda, the wandering ascetic.
Then after ascertaining that there was not a single bhikkhu who
had perplexity or doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha,
the Buddha uttered his last words: "Inherent in all compounded things is
decay and dissolution. Strive well with full mindfulness."
Then as the assembled bhikkhus, princes and people paid homage
to him with deep reverence, the Buddha passed away, realizing
parinibbæna.
(4) Mahæsudassana Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha while he was lying on
his death-bed in the Sal Grove of the Mallas. When Ænanda implored
him not to realize parinibbæna in an insignificant, barren, small town, the
Buddha told him that Kusinæræ was not an insignificant, small place. In
times long past, it was known as Kusævatø, the capital city of Universal
Monarchs who ruled over the four quarters of the world.
The Buddha then described the magnificence and grandeur of
Kusævatø when King Mahæsudassana was the ruler there. He also told
how the King ruled over his dominions righteously and how finally

51

abandoning all attachments and practicing jhæna he passed away and
reached the blissful Brahma realm.
The Buddha revealed that he himself was King Mahæsudassana of
that time. He had cast off the body in this place (former Kusævati) for six
times as a Universal Monarch. Now he was casting it off for the seventh
and last time. He ended the discourse reminding Ænanda that all
compounded things are indeed impermanent. Arising and decaying are
their inherent nature. Only their ultimate cessation is blissful Nibbæna.
(5) Janavasabha Sutta
This discourse is an extension of another discourse delivered by
the Buddha on his last Journey. Ænanda wanted to know the destinies of
lay disciples from the country of Magadha. The Buddha told him that
innumerable persons from Magadha had reached the deva world by virtue
of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha. This
information was given him by Janavasabha Deva who was formerly King
Bimbisæra. He informed the Buddha that there were regular assemblies of
devas in the deva realm on uposatha days when the king of the devas and
Sana³kumæra Brahmæ taught the Dhamma on development of the Bases
of Psychic Power, on the Three Opportunities, on the Four Methods of
Steadfast Mindfulness and the Seven Accessories of Concentration.
(6) Mahægovinda Sutta
In this discourse, Pañcasikha, a gandhabba deva, told the deva assembly
where Sana³kumæra Brahmæ taught the Dhamma as shown by
Mahægovinda, the Bodhisatta who had reached the Brahmæ world. The
Buddha said that Mahægovinda was none other than himself and
explained that the Dhamma he taught at that time could lead one only to
the Brahmæ World. With his Teaching now as Enlightened Buddha,
higher attainments such as the Sotæpatti, Sakadægæmi, Anægæmi and the
highest achievement Arahatta phala were possible.
(7) Mahæsamaya Sutta
The Buddha was residing in the Mahævana forest at Kapilavatthu
with a company of Arahats numbering five hundred. Then devas and
Brahmæs from ten thousand Cakkava¹as came to see the Buddha and the
community of bhikkhus. The Buddha told his disciples the names of the
devas and Brahmæs as listed in this sutta.

52

(8) Sakkapañha Sutta
Once when the Buddha was residing at the Indasæla Cave near
Ræjagaha, Sakka, the king of devas, came to him to ask certain questions.
He wanted to know why there was hostility and violence among various
beings. The Buddha told him it was envy and selfishness that brought
about hostility among beings. He further explained that envy and selfishness were caused by likes and dislikes, which in turn had their roots in
desire. And desire grew from mental preoccupation (vitakka) which had
its origin in saµsæra-expanding illusions (papañca-saññæ-sa³kha).
The Buddha then gave an outline of practices to remove these
saµsæra-expanding illusions including two types of quests, quests that
should be pursued and quests that should not be pursued.
(9) Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta
This sutta is one of the most important doctrinal discourses of the
Buddha. It propounds the only way 'for the purification of beings, for
overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete removal of pain
and grief, for the attainment of the right path, and for the realization of
Nibbæna.' This discourse, given directly to the bhikkhus at the market
town of Kammæsadhamma, defines 'the only way' as the Four Methods
of Steadfast Mindfulness made up of fourteen ways of contemplating the
body, nine ways of contemplating sensation, sixteen ways of contemplating the mind, and five ways of contemplating the dhamma. It ends with a
definite assurance of fruitful results: Arahatship in this very existence or
the state of an anægæmø within seven years, seven months or seven days.
(10) Pæyæsi Sutta
This discourse recounts how the Venerable Kumærakassapa
showed the right path to Governor Pæyæsi of Setabyæ town in Kosala
country. Governor Pæyæsi held the wrong belief: "There is no other
world; no beings arise again after death; there are no consequences of
good or bad deeds." The Venerable Kumærakassapa showed him the right
path, illustrating his teaching with numerous illuminating similes.
Ultimately Pæyæsi became full of faith and took refuge in the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Saµgha. The Venerable Kumærakassapa taught him
also the right kind of offerings to be made and that these offerings should
be made with due respect, by one's own hands, with due esteem and not
as if discarding them. Only under these conditions would the good deed
of offerings bear splendid fruits.

(c) Pæthika Vagga Pæ¹i
This division is made up of eleven shorter discourses of a
miscellaneous nature. They deal with the Buddha's rejection of wrong
and severe asceticism practised by followers of many sects; they deal also
with the periodical evolution and dissolution of the universe, the accounts
of Universal Monarchs and the thirty-two physiognomic characteristics
of a great man. There is one discourse, Si³gæla Sutta, addressed to a
young brahmin showing the duties to be performed by members of the
human society. The last two suttas, Sa³gøti and Dasuttara, are discourses
given by the Venerable Særiputta and they contain lists of doctrinal terms
classified according to subject matter and numerical units. The style of
their composition is different from the other nine suttas of the division.
(1) Pæthika Sutta
At the time of the Buddha, there were many other teachers with
their own disciples, holding different views on what constituted the holy
life, on the origin and development of the universe, and on the
performance of wonders and miracles. Sunakkhatta, a Licchvø prince,
became a disciple of the Buddha and was admitted into the Order.
But he found the discipline and the Teaching to be beyond him
and his comprehension; he became at the same time attracted to the
teachings and practices of other sects. He left the Order after three years.
Then becoming a follower of one of the sects he began to disparage the
teachings of the Buddha, and made slanderous attacks on the Buddha and
his disciples. In Pæthika Sutta are short discourses in which are accounts
of the Buddha's refutation and explanation with reference to many of
Sunakkhatta's accusations.
(2) Udumbarika Sutta
This discourse was given to Nigrodha the wandering ascetic and
his followers in the Park of the Queen Udumbarikæ near Ræjagaha, in
order to destroy their wrong doctrine and establish wholesome doctrine.
So obsessed were the wandering ascetics with their own wrong beliefs
that they gave no response to the Buddha's invitation to follow his
Teaching assuring them fruitful results within seven days.

54

(3) Cakkavatti Sutta
In the town of Mætulæ, in the country of Magadha, bhikkhus were
enjoined by the Buddha to be their own support, their own refuge; relying
only on the Dhamma and not on any other refuge. Then the Buddha told
them the story of Dalhanemi, the Universal Monarch, who possessed the
Celestial Wheel as one of his seven treasures. He and his successor ruled
over the four continents, wielding the power and authority of the
Universal Monarch. Their life-span was long and as long as they
remained righteous and fulfilled the noble duties of Universal Monarch,
making the Dhamma their only support, providing shelter and security,
offering wealth and necessities to the needy, their dominions remained at
peace, prosperous and progressing.
But when the Monarch failed to fulfill the noble duties of a
righteous king, when the Dhamma was no longer held as a refuge, morality
of the people declines. The life-span dwindled down to ten years only. Then
ten meritorious deeds productive of wholesome effects completely
disappeared and ten evil deeds giving unwholesome results flourished
exceedingly. People failed to show reverential regard for the leaders and
elders, to fulfil their duties towards parents, sama¼as and bræhma¼as. There
also developed intense mutual aversion, ill will, thoughts of killing one
another, followed by fighting, devastation and carnage.
A few who survived the holocaust agreed to give up their evil
ways, to live in a spirit of harmony, doing good deeds, showing
reverential regard for the leaders and elders, fulfilling their duties towards
parents, sama¼as and bræhma¼as. In consequence of improved morality,
their life-span expanded again until it reached eighty thousand years
when a Universal Monarch appeared once more to rule righteously.
Bhikkhus were thus enjoined to keep within the confines of the Dhamma,
making it their support, their refuge. The Dhamma would show the way
for their physical and mental development until they attained Arahatship.
(4) Aggañña Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi to two novices under
training, Væse¥¥ha and Bhæradvæja, pointing out the wrong beliefs of
brahmins as regards caste. The brahmins claimed that among the four
classes of people, recognised at that time, brahmins were the noblest;
next came the Khattiya class, the nobility and royalty; followed by Vessa,
the trading class and Sudda, the lowest class.

55

The Buddha refuted these claims of the brahmins, by explaining
how the world was subjected to processes of evolution and dissolution
and describing how human beings first appeared on earth and how the
four social classes emerged. He explained further that the nobility of a
person was decided not by his birth and lineage but by his morality and
knowledge of the Noble Truths.
"Whoever holds wrong views and commits misdeeds is not noble
whatever his birth. Whoever restrains himself in deed, word and thought
and develops the Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas until he attains complete
eradication of defilements in this very life is the chief, the noblest
amongst men and devas irrespective of birth."
(5) Sampasædanøya Sutta
The Venerable Særiputta's deep confidence in the Buddha was
once proclaimed aloud in an eloquent eulogy of the Buddha spoken in the
Buddha's presence. For making this bold utterance on the virtues of the
Buddha, the Buddha asked him whether he had personal knowledge of
the minds of all the Buddhas, those of the past, of the future and of the
present, their Morality, their Concentration, their Wisdom, and the
manner of their emancipation.
The Venerable Særiputta said he did not claim to have such
knowledge but justified himself by stating in detail the course of the
Dhamma taken by all the Buddhas — their accomplishment in søla,
abandonment of five hindrances, establishment in the four Methods of
Steadfast Mindfulness and cultivation of the Seven Factors of
Enlightenment — the only course that could lead to unsurpassed
Supreme Enlightenment.
(6) Pæsædika Sutta
The Venerable Ænanda accompanied by bhikkhu Cunda went to
see the Buddha to give him the news about the death of Niga¼¥ha
Næ¥aputta, the leader of a well-known sect, and the schism that had arisen
amongst his disciples.
The Buddha told them that it was natural and to be expected to
happen in a Teaching which was not well taught, not well imparted, not
conducive to emancipation, and not taught by one who was supremely
enlightened.

56

In contrast, the Buddha explained that when the Teaching was
well taught, well imparted by one who was supremely enlightened, there
were no wrong views, no speculations about past or future or about atta.
In the Teaching of the Buddha, bhikkhus were taught the Four Methods
of Steadfast Mindfulness by which wrong views and speculations were
laid aside.
(7) Lakkha¼a Sutta
This discourse on thirty-two bodily marks of a great man was
given by the Buddha at Sævatthi, in the Anæthapi¼ðika's Monastery. For
a person endowed with the thirty-two bodily marks of a great man, only
two possible courses are open to him and no other.
"If he lives the household life, he will become a Universal Monarch ruling in righteousness over the four continents. If he goes forth from
the home life into homelessness, he will become an Enlightened Buddha."
The Buddha explained the thirty-two bodily marks in detail,
together with accounts of meritorious deeds previously performed by
virtue of which each of these thirty-two bodily marks were acquired.
(8) Si³gæla Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Ræjagaha for the
edification of a young man named Si³gæla. The youth Si³gæla used to
worship the six cardinal points, namely, the East, the South, the West, the
North, the Nadir and the Zenith in obedience to the last advice given by
his dying father. The Buddha explained to the young man that according to
his Teaching, the six directions were: The East standing for parents; The
South standing for teachers; The West standing for the wife and children;
The North standing for friends and associates; The Nadir standing for
servants, employees; The Zenith standing for sama¼as, bræhma¼as.
The Buddha explained further that the six social groups
mentioned in the discourse were to be regarded as sacred and worthy of
respect and worship. One worshipped them by performing one's duties
towards them. Then these duties were explained to the youth Si³gæla.
(9) Æ¥ænæ¥iya Sutta
Four Celestial Kings came to see the Buddha and told him that
there were non-believers among many invisible beings who might bring

57

harm to the followers of the Buddha. The Celestial Kings therefore
wanted to teach the bhikkhus the protecting incantation known as the
Æ¥ænæ¥iya Paritta. The Buddha gave his consent by remaining silent.
Then the four Celestial Kings recited the Æ¥ænæ¥iya Paritta, which
the Buddha advised bhikkhus, bhikkhunøs and lay disciples to learn, to
memorize so that they might dwell at ease, well guarded and protected.
(10) Sa³gøti Sutta
The Buddha was touring through the country of the Mallas when
he came to Pævæ. The death of Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta had taken place only
recently and his followers were left in dissension and strife, wrangling
over doctrines.
The Venerable Særiputta who delivered this discourse attributed
this schism among Næ¥aputta's followers to the fact that Næ¥aputta's
Teaching had not been well taught nor well imparted, and was not
conducive to release from the round of existences, being taught by one
who was not supremely enlightened.
But the Buddha's Teaching was well taught, well imparted,
conducive to release from the round of existences, being taught by the
Buddha who was supremely enlightened. He advised the bhikkhus to
recite the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha, in concord and without
dissension so that the teaching should last long. Then he proceeded to
enumerate the Dhamma classified under separate heads as Group of the
Ones, Group of the Twos, etc, up to the Group of the Tens to facilitate
easy memorizing and reciting.
(11) Dasuttara Sutta
This discourse was also delivered by the Venerable Særiputta,
while the Buddha was staying at Campæ, in order that the bhikkhus
should get liberated from fetters, and attain Nibbæna, bringing about the
end of suffering.
He taught the Dhamma classified under separate heads as Group
of the ones, Group of the Twos, etc., up to the Group of the Tens.

58

Chapter V
Majjhima Nikæya
Collection of Medium Length Discourses of the Buddha.
This collection of medium length discourses is made up of one
hundred and fifty-two suttas in three books known as pa¼¼æsa. The first
book, Mþlapa¼¼æsa, deals with the first fifty suttas in five vaggas; the
second book, Majjhimapa¼¼æsa consists of the second fifty suttas in five
vaggas too; and the last fifty-two suttas are dealt with in five vaggas of
the third book, Uparipa¼¼æsa, which means more than fifty.
The suttas in this Nikæya throw much light on the social ideas
and institutions of those days, and also provide general information on
the economic and political life.
(a) Mþlapa¼¼æsa Pæ¹i
I. Mþlapariyæya Vagga
(1) Mþlapariyæya Sutta
The Buddha explained the basis of all phenomena, specifying
twenty-four categories such as the four elements (earth, water, fire,
wind); sentient beings, devas; the seen, the heard, the thought of, the
known; the oneness, the multiplicity, the whole; and the reality of
Nibbæna. The uninstructed worldling cannot perceive the true nature of
these phenomena; only the enlightened ones can see them in true
perspective.
(2) Sabbæsava Sutta
In this discourse, mental intoxicants that beset the uninstructed
worldling are defined, and seven practices for eradicating them are explained.
(3) Dhammadæyæda Sutta
This sutta contains two separate discourses, the first one given
by the Buddha, the second by the Venerable Særiputta. The Buddha urged
the bhikkhus to receive as their legacy from him the Bodhipakkhiya
Dhamma only, and not material things like the four requisites. The
Venerable Særiputta advised the bhikkhus to lead a solitary life for
attainment of jhæna and to strive for the attainment of Nibbæna by
abandoning greed, ill will, and delusion.

59

(4) Bhayabherava Sutta
This discourse describes how a bhikkhu leading a solitary life in
a secluded forest invites harm and danger to himself by his impure
thoughts, words and deeds, and how the Buddha had lived a peaceful
forest life harmlessly by cultivating pure thoughts, words and deeds
which finally led him to enlightenment.
(5) Ana³ga¼a Sutta
In this discourse given on the request of the Venerable Mahæ
Moggallæna, the Venerable Særiputta explained four types of individuals:
(i) an impure person who knows he is impure;
(ii) an impure person who does not know he is impure;
(iii) a pure person who knows his own purity;
(iv) a pure person who does not know his own purity.
(6) Æka³kheyya Sutta
This sutta describes how a bhikkhu should develop søla,
samædhi and paññæ, instead of hankering after gain and fame; how he
should restrain his faculties, seeing danger in the slightest fault.
(7) Vattha Sutta
In this discourse the Buddha explained the difference between an
impure mind and a pure mind by giving the example of dirty cloth and
clean cloth. Only the clean cloth will absorb dye; so also only the pure
mind will retain the dhamma.
(8) Sallekha Sutta
In this discourse the Buddha explained to Mahæ Cunda how
wrong views about atta and loka can be removed only by vipassanæ
insight. Jhænic practice is not the austerity practice that removes moral
defilements; jhænic practice only leads to a blissful existence.
Only refraining from forty-four kinds of bad deeds constitutes
austerity practice for removing moral defilements. The volition alone to
do a good deed is enough to produce a good result; when it is
accompanied by the actual deed, the beneficial result accruing is
immeasurable. One immersed in the mire of sensuous impurities cannot
rescue others immersed likewise in the mire.

60

(9) Sammædi¥¥hi Sutta
This discourse is an exposition on the right view delivered by the
Venerable Særiputta at Sævatthi. When physical, verbal and mental
actions are motivated by greed, hatred and delusion, they are deemed to
be bad. When they arise through non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion,
the actions are deemed to be good. Right View is understanding what a
good deed is and what a bad deed is; it is the full comprehension of the
Four Noble Truths and not holding on to eternity views concerning atta.
(10) Mahæsatipa¥¥hæna Sutta
This discourse given at Kammæsadhamma market town is the
most important sutta which gives practical guidance for cultivation of
mindfulness. It describes the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness,
namely, contemplating the body, contemplating sensation, contemplating
the mind, and contemplating the dhamma as the one and only way for the
purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for
the complete destruction of pain and distress, for the attainment of the
Noble Magga, and for the realization of Nibbæna,
This sutta appears in identical form in the Døgha Nikæya.
II. Søhanæda Vagga
(1) Cþ¹asøhanæda Sutta
In this discourse, given at Sævatthi, the Buddha made the bold
statement that the four Categories of Ariyas, namely, the Stream-winner,
the Once-returner, the Non-returner and the Arahat exist only in his
Teaching and not in any other.
(2) Mæhasøhanæda Sutta
In this discourse, given at Vesælø, the Venerable Særiputta
reported to the Buddha about the disparagement of the Buddha's virtues
made by Sunakkhatta who had left the Teaching. The Buddha said that
Sunakkhatta was not intellectually equipped to have the faintest glimpse
of the Buddha's virtues such as the Ten Strengths, the four kinds of
supreme Self-Confidence, the Non-decline of Sabbaññuta Ñæ¼a till the
time of parinibbæna. He then described the five destinations and the
actions which lead to them as well as the wrong beliefs and practices of
the naked ascetics to whose camp Sunakkhatta now belonged.

61

(3) Mahædukkhakkhandha Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi to refute the naked ascetics
when they tried to make out that they followed the same path and taught
the same dhamma as the Buddha. The Buddha also explained to the
bhikkhus what the pleasures of the senses were, what their faults and
dangers were, and the way of escape from them. The Buddha explained
further that outside of his Teaching, these dhammas were not known and
no one but the Buddha and his disciples could teach such dhammas.
(4) Cþ¹adukkhakkhandha Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha, at Kapilavatthu to the
Sakyan Prince Mahænæma to explain to him on his request, how greed, ill
will and ignorance caused moral defilements and suffering.
(5) Anumæna Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna to
many bhikkhus at Susumæragira in the country of Bhagga. They were
urged to see if they had purged themselves of sixteen kinds of
stubbornness such as inordinate desire, humiliating others while praising
oneself, wrathfulness, etc. If these sixteen kinds of unwholesome
dhammas were detected in oneself, a determined effort should be made to
get rid of them.
(6) Cetokhila Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha at Sævatthi, mentions the five
kinds of mental thorns: doubt about the Buddha, doubt about the
Dhamma, doubt about the Saµgha, doubt about the efficacy of the
practice in søla, samædhi and paññæ, ill will and animosity towards fellow
bhikkhus. It also mentions the five fetters: attachment to sensual desires,
attachment to oneself, attachment to material objects; immoderation in
eating and sleeping, and adopting the holy life with the limited objective
of attaining to blissful existences only. These mental thorns and fetters
are obstacles to liberation from dukkha. They should be removed and
eradicated for realization of Nibbæna.

62

(7) Vanapattha Sutta
This discourse, given at Sævatthi, is concerned with the choice of
a suitable place for a bhikkhu. A bhikkhu has to depend on a forest glade
or a village, or a town or an individual for his residence and support. If he
finds out any particular place is not satisfactory for his spiritual development or for material support, he should abandon that place at once.
If he finds it satisfactory with respect to material support, but not
beneficial for spiritual development, he should abandon that place, too.
But when it proves beneficial for spiritual development, even if the
material support is meagre, the bhikkhu should stay on in that place.
When conditions are satisfactory both for spiritual development and
material support, he should live for the whole of his life in such a place.
(8) Madhupi¼ðika Sutta
A Sakyan Prince, named Da¼ðapæni, once asked the Buddha at
Kapilavatthu what doctrine he taught. The Buddha replied that his
doctrine was one which could not be grasped by any brahmin nor by the
Mæra. It is this: not living in discord with any one in the world; not
obsessed by sense impressions (saññæ); not troubled by doubts; and not
craving for any form of existence.
(9) Dvedævitakka Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi to explain two kinds
of thinking: wholesome and unwholesome. Bhikkhus should practice to
see the advantages of engaging in wholesome thoughts and the dangers of
unwholesome thoughts.
(10) Vitakkasa¼¥hæna Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi on how to
combat the arising of unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts.
For example, greed and sensuous thoughts should be banished by
contemplating on unpleasantness and impermanency of the object of
desire; ill will and hatred must be countered by thoughts of lovingkindness; and ignorance may be overcome by seeking illumination and
guidance from the teacher.

63

III. Opamma Vagga
(1) Kakacþpama Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi in connection
with Bhikkhu Mo¹iyaphagguna who was friendly with bhikkhunøs. When
others censured him for being too friendly with bhikkhunøs, he lost his
temper and broke into quarrel with bhikkhus who criticized him.
When the Buddha admonished and advised him to keep away
from bhikkhunøs and to control his temper, he remained recalcitrant. The
Buddha showed the harmfulness of ill temper and advised other bhikkhus
to keep a tight check on their temper, not losing it even when some one
was sawing away their limbs into bits.
(2) Alagaddþpama Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi. Bhikkhu
Ari¥¥ha misunderstood the Buddha's Teaching and maintained that the
Buddha showed how to enjoy sensuous pleasure without jeopardising
one's progress in the Path. When the Buddha remonstrated with him for
his wrong views he remained unrepentant.
The Buddha then spoke to the bhikkhus on the wrong way and the
right way of learning the dhamma, giving the simile of a snake catcher,
and the simile of the raft.
(3) Vammika Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi. Venerable
Kumærakassapa was asked by a deva a set of fifteen questions which he
brought to the Buddha for elucidation. The Buddha explained to him the
meaning of the questions and assisted him in their solution.
(4) Rathavinøta Sutta
This sutta recounts the dialogue between the Venerable Særiputta
and the Venerable Pu¼¼a at Sævatthi on the seven stages of purity, such
as purity of søla, purity of mind, purity of view etc., that must be passed
before attainment to Nibbæna.

64

(5) Nivæpa Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi on the snares
that waylay bhikkhus on their path, making use of the simile of the hunter,
the hunter's followers, the green pasture and four different herds of deer.
The hunter was likened to Mæra, the hunter's crowd to Mæra's followers,
the green pasture he had set up to the sensuous pleasures, and four different herds of deer to four different types of recluses who left home life.
(6) Pæsaræsi Sutta
This sutta given by the Buddha at Sævatthi is also known by the
name of Ariyapariyesana Sutta. The Buddha recounted his life from the
time he was born in the human world as the son of King Suddhodana till
the moment of the great discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of
Dhamma, giving details of his renunciation, initial wrong practices of
severe asceticism and final discovery of the Noble Path of Eight
Constituents. In particular, stress was laid on two different types of
quests, the Noble and the Ignoble. He explained that it was extremely
unwise to go after sensual pleasures which subject one to ageing, disease
and death. The most noble quest was to seek out that which will liberate
one from ageing, disease and death.
(7) Cþ¹ahatthipadopama Sutta
This sutta was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi. The Brahmin
Jæ¼usso¼i asked the wandering ascetic Pilotika, who had just come back
from the Buddha, whether he knew all the virtues and accomplishments
of the Buddha. The wandering ascetic replied that only a Buddha who
could match another Buddha in attainments could know all the virtues of
the other. As for him, he could only exercise his imagination in this
respect just as a hunter would judge the measurements of an elephant
from the size of its footprints.
Later when the Brahmin Jæ¼usso¼i went to see the Buddha, and
recounted his conversation with the wandering ascetic the Buddha told
him that the size of an elephant's footprint might still be misleading.
Only when one followed the footprints, and the animal was seen grazing
in the open, its true measurements could be accurately judged. So also the
virtues of the Buddha and his Teaching could be fully appreciated and
understood only when one followed his Teaching and practised as taught
by him until the final goal of Arahatship was reached.

65

(8) Mahæhatthipadopama Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Særiputta to the
bhikkhus at Sævatthi using the simile of the elephant's footprint. He
explained that just as the footprint of all animals could be contained
within the footprint of an elephant, all wholesome dhammas were
comprised in the Four Noble Truths.
(9) Mahæsæropama Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Ræjagaha in
connection with Devadatta who remained contented with gain and fame
because of his attainment of supernormal powers and left the Teaching to
cause schism in the Order. The Buddha said that this Teaching was not
for the purpose of gain and fame which were like the external shoots and
branches of a tree; nor just for the accomplishment in søla which may be
likened to the outer crust of a tree; nor for mere establishing of
concentration to achieve supernormal powers which were like the bark of
a tree. The Dhamma was taught for the attainment of Arahatship, the
noble liberation which alone resembled the inner pith of a tree.
(10) Cþ¹asæropama Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi in connection
with the Brahmin Pi³galakoccha who asked the Buddha whether all the
six teachers claiming to be Buddhas were really enlightened. The Buddha
explained that the Brahmacariya practice taught by a Buddha led to Arahatship, not just to the achievement of gain and fame, or supernormal powers.

IV. Mahæyamaka Vagga
(1) Cþ¹agosi³ga Sutta
The Venerable Anuruddha, the Venerable Nandiya and the
Venerable Kimila were staying in the Gosi³ga Sal tree woodland. The
Buddha visited them and praised them on their way of living, practising
the holy life with perfect harmony and concord amongst themselves, thus
forming an adornment to the lovely woodland park.

66

(2) Mahægosi³ga Sutta
Once while the Buddha was residing in the Gosi³ga Sal tree
woodland, the Venerable Særiputta asked the Buddha: 'Who would most
adorn this woodland park and enhance its beauty?' The discourse records
the different answers provided by the Venerables Revata, Anuruddha,
Mahæ Kassapa, Mahæ Moggallæna, Særiputta and by the Buddha himself.
(3) Mahægopælaka Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha at Sævatthi, explains the
conditions under which the Teaching would grow and prosper and the
conditions under which it would decline and decay. The example of a
cowherd is given. When a cowherd is equipped with eleven skills of
managing and tending his cattle, there is progress and growth in his work.
So also when the bhikkhu is skilled and accomplished in eleven factors
such as knowledge of truth about the khandhas, practice of søla, samædhi
and paññæ etc., the Teaching will grow and prosper.
(4) Cþ¹agopælaka Sutta
This discourse deals with eleven factors, the failure to fulfil which
would contribute to the downfall and ruin of the Teaching. Just as the
cattle under the care of an unwise and unskilful cowherd crossed the river
from a wrong quay on the bank and met with destruction instead of
reaching the other shore, so also the followers of the teachers who were
not accomplished in the knowledge of truth, khandhas, etc., would end up
only in disaster.
(5) Cþ¹asaccaka Sutta
This discourse, given at Vesælø, gives an account of the debate
between the Buddha and Saccaka the wandering ascetic on the subject of
atta. Saccaka maintained that rþpa, vedanæ, saññæ, sa³khæra and viññæ¼a
were one's atta. It was atta which enjoyed the fruits of good deeds and
suffered the consequences of bad deeds. The Buddha refuted his theory,
pointing out that none of the khandhas was atta, each being subjected to
the laws of anicca, dukkha, and anatta, and not amenable to anyone's
control. Saccaka had to admit his defeat in the presence of his followers.

67

(6) Mahæsaccaka Sutta
The same Saccaka, the wandering ascetic, came again to the
Buddha the next day and asked about the cultivation of mind and body.
He knew only the wrong methods of developing concentration. The
Buddha explained to Saccaka the various practices he himself had
followed and mistakes he had made until he found the middle Path that
finally led him to the realization of Nibbæna.
(7) Cþ¹ata¼hæsa³khaya Sutta
On enquiry by the king of devas how a disciple of the Buddha
trained himself to realize Nibbæna, the Buddha gave him a short
description of how a householder, after leaving his home, put himself on
a course of training that gradually purified his mind of all moral
defilements and led him to the final goal.
(8) Mahæta¼hæsa³khaya Sutta
A disciple of the Buddha, Sæti by name, held the view that the
Buddha taught: 'The same consciousness transmigrates and wanders
about.' Other disciples tried to rid him of this wrong view but to no avail.
The Buddha told him that he never taught such wrong views. He only
taught: 'Consciousness arises out of conditions; there is no arising of
Consciousness without conditions.'
(9) Mahæ-assapura Sutta
The people of Assapura, a market town of A³ga country, were
ardently devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha, helping
and assisting the members of the Order by offering them the bhikkhu
requisites. Out of gratitude for such support, the Buddha urged the
bhikkhus to make strenuous efforts in their training and practice of
Dhamma, gradually going up stage by stage: starting from avoiding evil
deeds by restraint of physical and vocal actions, to proceed to mental
restraint through meditation, then progressing towards attainment of four
stages of jhæna, and finally to the stage where all moral defilements were
eliminated and Nibbæna was attained.

68

(10) Cþ¹a-assapura Sutta
Out of gratitude for the support given by the lay devotees of
Assapura, a market town in the country of A³ga, the Buddha urged the
bhikkhus to be worthy of the name of sama¼a and bræhma¼a. Sama¼a
means one who has stilled his passions; bræhma¼a one who has rid himself
of defilements. A bhikkhu should therefore subject himself to the course of
discipline and practice as laid down by the Buddha until he had eliminated
the twelve defilements such as envy, ill will, deceit, wrong views, etc.

V. Cþ¹ayamaka Vagga
(1) Sæ¹eyyaka Sutta
This exposition was given to villagers of Sælæ on ten
demeritorious deeds that would lead to states of misery and woe and ten
meritorious deeds that would give rise to rebirth in happy realms.
(2) Verañjaka Sutta
This discourse was given to the householders of Verañjæ dealing
with identical subjects as in the Sæleyyaka Sutta.
(3) Mahævedalla Sutta
The Venerable Mahæko¥¥hika asked many questions to the
Venerable Særiputta at Sævatthi regarding an uninstructed person with no
paññæ, and instructed persons with paññæ; many questions on viññæ¼a
and vedanæ, on the difference between paññæ and viññæ¼a, and many
other things. The Venerable Særiputta obliged him with detailed answers.
(4) Cþ¹avedalla Sutta
Therø Dhammadinnæ was asked many questions by the
householder Visækha about personality, Sakkæya, the origin of Sakkæya,
the cessation of Sakkæya and the way leading to cessation of Sakkæya.
All the questions were satisfactorily answered by the Therø.

69

(5) Cþ¹adhammasamædæna Sutta
This sutta describes four practices involving: (i) happy living
now, followed by dire consequences in the future; (ii) unhappy living
now, followed by dire consequences in the future; (iii) unhappy living
now, followed by a happy life in the future; (iv) happy living now,
followed by a happy life in the future.
(6) Mahædhammasamædæna Sutta
In this discourse, the four practices as described in
Cþ¹adhammasamædæna Sutta are explained with more details giving
similes of poisoned fruit juice, delicious cordial and medicinal
preparation of cow's urine.
(7) Vømaµsaka Sutta
Any claim to Buddhahood may be put to acid tests as provided in
this sutta. A detailed procedure to scrutinize such claim is laid down here.
(8) Kosambiya Sutta
This discourse on how loving-kindness should be the basis of
their relations was given by the Buddha to the bhikkhus of Kosambø who
were living in discord because of disagreement over trifling matters.
(9) Brahmanimantanika Sutta
The Brahmæ Baka held the wrong view of eternity, believing in
permanence, stability, and endurance. The Buddha showed him how
wrong his belief was.
(10) Mæratajjanøya Sutta
This is an account given by the Venerable Mahæ Mogallæna of
how Mæra once troubled him by causing pains and aches in the stomach.
He had to coax him to stop annoying him by telling him that he had been
Mæra's uncle at the time of Kakusandha Buddha.

70

(b) Majjhima Pa¼¼æsa Pæ¹i
I. Gahapati Vagga
(1) Kandaraka Sutta
This discourse was delivered at Campæ in connection with
Kandaraka, the wandering ascetic, and Pessa, son of an elephant rider,
who marvelled at the silence maintained by the huge congregation of
bhikkhus, not making any sound, not even a sneeze nor a cough. The
Buddha explained that their silence was due to their accomplishments in
samædhi and to their training on four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness.
The Buddha also elucidated the four types of individuals engaged in
meditation.
(2) A¥¥hakanægara Sutta
The householder Dasama of A¥¥haka wanted to know if there was
a single dhamma which could cause liberation and realization of
Nibbæna. The Venerable Ænanda informed him there was a group of
dhammas, eleven in number, namely, the four jhænas, the four
Brahmavihæra practices, and Ækæsænañcæyatana, Viññæ¼añcæyatana,
Ækiñcaññæyatana. Contemplating the impermanent nature of each of
these dhammas would lead one to Nibbæna.
(3) Sekha Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Ænanda to the
Sakyans headed by Prince Mahænæma. The Venerable Ænanda explained
the path consisting of three steps, søla, samædhi and paññæ to be followed
by an aspirant to higher knowledge culminating in the knowledge of
cessation of æsava.
(4) Potaliya Sutta
Potaliya had left worldly affairs behind with a view to lead the
holy life. When the Buddha saw him dressed in ordinary everyday attire,
the Buddha addressed him as 'Gahapati', householder, which Potaliya
resented. The Buddha explained to him that in the vocabulary of the
Vinaya one was said to have cut oneself off from the world only when
one refrained from killing, stealing, telling lies, slandering, and only
when one was abstemious, not conceited, and controlled in one's temper.

71

(5) Jøvaka Sutta
This discourse was given at Ræjagaha in connection with Jøvaka,
the great physician, who enquired whether it was true that the Buddha ate
the meat of animals killed purposely for him. The Buddha told him that
he had made it a rule for the bhikkhus not to partake of any meat which
they saw or heard or had reason to suspect to be especially prepared for
them. Further, a bhikkhu should not show eagerness for food nor be
greedy in eating; he should eat with reflection that he took the meal only
to sustain the body in order to pursue the path of liberation.
(6) Upæli Sutta
A prominent, wealthy lay disciple of Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta was sent
by his master to meet the Buddha and defeat him in argument on certain
aspects of the Theory of Kamma. Whereas the Niga¼¥ha stressed on the
physical and vocal actions being more productive of resultant effects, the
Buddha maintained that it was volition or mental action that was
paramount. By means of his discourse the Buddha converted Upæli, and
overwhelmed by intense wrath over the loss of his most prominent
disciple, Næ¥aputta died.
(7) Kukkuravatika Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha to two naked ascetics named
Pu¼¼a and Seniya at the market town of Koliya, deals with four kinds of
actions and four kinds of resultant effects arising therefrom: (i) black
deed leading to black result, (i) white deed leading to white result, (iii)
deed which is both black and white leading to result which is both black
and white and (iv) deed which is neither black nor white leading to result
which is neither black nor white.
(8) Abhayaræjakumæra Sutta
Prince Abhayaræjakumæra was sent by Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta to ask
the Buddha whether he uttered unpleasant words about the destiny of
Devadatta. The Buddha enumerated six modes of utterances out of which
he would make two modes of utterances: words which are true, profitable
but not pleasant to others and words which are true, profitable and
pleasant to others.

72

(9) Bahuvedanøya Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi to explain the various kinds
of vedanæ which might be two in number: sukha and dukkha vedanæs; or
three in number by including the upekkhæ vedanæ; or five, six, eighteen
or thirty-six, or one hundred and eight, depending on the method of
enumeration. Ordinarily sensations that arise from pleasures of the senses
are regarded as sukha, or happiness. But the Buddha explains that the
acme of happiness is attainment of nirodha samæpatti.
(10) Apa¼¼aka Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha to the villagers of Sælæ in
the country of Kosala who had not yet accepted any of the teachings
taught by leaders of the various sects visiting their village. The Buddha
showed them the right path which would not lead them astray. The wrong
views of the sectarians were contrasted against the right views
propounded by the Buddha; the disadvantages of wrong views, and the
advantages of right views were explained.

II. Bhikkhu Vagga
(1) Ambala¥¥hikaræhulovæda Sutta
In this discourse, given at Ræjagaha, the Buddha exhorted his son
Ræhula, a sæma¼era aged seven, on the necessity of observing the
fundamental moral precept of truthfulness, and of practising mindfulness,
by giving the similes of the upturned water pot, the royal elephant and the
mirror.
(2) Mahæræhulovæda Sutta
This discourse on the five khandhas was given at Sævatthi by the
Buddha to Ræhula at the age of eighteen. The Venerable Særiputta also
taught Ræhula the meditation on Ænæpæna. The Buddha further explained
to him the advantages of Ænæpæna meditation and gave him another
discourse on the four great elements.

73

(3) Cþ¹amælukya Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi to the bhikkhu Mælukya.
Bhikkhu Mælukya interrupted his meditation one afternoon, went to the
Buddha and asked him the wellknown classical questions: Is the universe
eternal or not etc.; is the soul the same as the body, is soul one thing and
body another, etc.; does life exist after death, or does it not exist after death.
The Buddha explained to him that the practice of the holy life did
not depend upon these views. Whatever view one may hold about them,
there would still be birth, ageing, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, distress. The Buddha said that he taught only about dukkha, the
cause of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha and the way leading to the
cessation of dukkha.
(4) Mahæmælukya Sutta
This discourse was given to bhikkhu Mælukya at Sævatthi to
explain the five fetters, namely, personality belief, doubt, attachment to
wrong practice, sensual desires and ill will, which lead beings to lower
destinations.
(5) Bhaddæli Sutta
This discourse, given at Sævatthi, is an exhortation to bhikkhu
Bhaddæli who refused to obey the disciplinary rule of not eating after
midday and in the evening; the Buddha explained why bhikkhus in the
Teaching should respect the disciplinary rules laid down by him.
(6) La¥ukikopama Sutta
This discourse was given to the Venerable Udæyi in connection
with observance of disciplinary rules and precepts. When the five
strengths (balas), namely, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and
insight are not well developed, the bhikkhu finds even a paltry restraint
like refraining from eating meals in the afternoon and in the evening very
irksome and onerous. But when the five Balas are fully developed, even
stringent rules can be observed without any difficulty or discomfort.

74

(7) Cætuma Sutta
This discourse was given at Cætuma to the disciples of the
Venerable Særiputta and the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna, who came
with five hundred bhikkhus to see the Buddha. The five hundred
bhikkhus made a lot of noise while settling down. The Buddha refused to
see them at first, but later relented and taught them the dangers in the life
of a bhikkhu. Just as there are dangers and hazards in a sea like stormy
waves, crocodiles, whirlpools, and sharks, so also there are dangers
against which the bhikkhu must be always on guard, namely, ill will
against those who instruct them and guide them; dissatisfaction with
training rules such as those concerning taking of meals or dealing with
womenfolk; and pleasures of senses.
(8) Na¹akapæna Sutta
This discourse was given to the Venerable Anuruddha and to the
villagers of Na¹akapæna to explain that unless a bhikkhu had attained the
higher stages of Magga and Phala, accomplishments in supernormal
psychic powers may prove to be harmful to him. The Buddha himself
talked about the destinations of the departed persons not to earn praise
and admiration but to arouse enthusiasm and faith in his disciples.
(9) Goliyæni Sutta
This discourse was given at Ræjagaha by the Venerable Særiputta
to Goliyæni Bhikkhu concerning eighteen dhammas which a forest
dwelling bhikkhu should observe.
(10) Kø¥ægiri Sutta
This discourse was given at the market town of Kø¥ægiri on the
advantages of taking meals only before noon and the disadvantages of
eating in the evening.
III. Paribbæjaka Vagga
(1) Tevijjavaccha Sutta
Vacchagotta, the wandering ascetic, questioned the Buddha
whether it would be true to say that Sabbaññuta Ñæ¼a was constantly and
continuously present to him all the time, while walking or standing,

75

asleep or awake. The Buddha replied that it would not be true to say so. It
would be true to say only that the Buddha was accomplished in the three
kinds of knowledge, namely, knowledge of the past, power of divine
seeing, and knowledge of liberation.
(2) Aggivaccha Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi in connection
with Vacchagotta who approached the Buddha quite often to ask many
questions about atta. On this occasion too he asked the Buddha whether
there was atta, whether atta was permanent, etc. The Buddha told him he
held no theories about atta because he had seen the nature of things as
they really were. Then he explained to him the dhamma in some detail.
(3) Mahævaccha Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha to Vacchagotta at
Ræjagaha. On his Visit to the Buddha after a long interval, Vacchagotta
no longer troubled the Buddha with his speculations about atta, loka, etc.;
instead, he requested to be taught on good and bad deeds (Kusalækusalaµ
Kammaµ) in brief. The Buddha explained to him the dhamma on good
and bad deeds in brief as well as in detail.
Vacchagotta became a disciple of the Buddha and received
admission into the Order. Then practising the dhamma as instructed, he
ultimately attained Arahatship, realizing Nibbæna. The problems of atta,
loka, etc., no longer obsessed him.
(4) Døghanakha Sutta
This important discourse was given by the Buddha in the
Sþkarakhata Cave near Ræjagaja, to Døghanakha, the wandering ascetic, a
nephew of the Venerable Særiputta, in order to remove his wrong views
of annihilation. As the Buddha taught him the dhamma contemplation of
the body and contemplation of sensation (sukha, dukkha, adukkhamasukha), his uncle the Venerable Særiputta was standing behind the
Buddha, fanning him. It was only fifteen days ago that the Venerable
Særiputta had been admitted into the Order by the Buddha. While
following the progress of the discourse, as though sharing the food
prepared for another, the Venerable Særiputta advanced rapidly from the
stage of a Sotæpanna which he had already reached, and attained the
perfect state of Arahatship with the fourfold Analytical Knowledge

76

(Pa¥isambhidæ Ñæ¼a), At the end of the discourse his nephew, the
wandering ascetic Døghanakha, became a Sotæpanna.
(5) Mæga¼ðiya Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at the market town of
Kammæsadhamma in the Kuru country in connection with Mæga¼ðiya,
the wandering ascetic, who resented the Buddha's criticism of his wrong
beliefs. The Buddha exhorted him to practice control of the senses and
sensuous thoughts. He told the wandering ascetic the story of his
renunciation, how he had left his luxurious palaces and how, on
discovering the Truth, he found happiness in Arahattaphala which was far
superior to any of the sensuous pleasures. Mæga¼ðiya gave up his wrong
views to become a disciple of the Buddha.
(6) Sandaka Sutta
This discourse was given at Kosambø to Sandaka, the wandering
ascetic, and his followers by the Venerable Ænanda. The Venerable
Ænanda explained to them the four wrong views of sect-leaders who held
there was no existence after death, that there was no evil nor good, no
cause for any phenomena, and that there were only aggregates of seven
elements. Finally he taught the wandering ascetics the dhamma as
expounded by the Buddha. As a consequence of his teaching, Sandaka
and his followers abandoned their wrong views and became disciples of
the Buddha.
(7) Mahæsakuludæyi Sutta
At one time the Buddha and his company of bhikkhus were residing
at Ræjagaha where six leaders of sects were also spending the rains with
their respective followers. Then Udæyø, the wandering ascetic, who was
visited by the Buddha, extolled the virtues of the Buddha saying that
other leaders were sometimes criticized even by their followers,
l. Vide., Majjhimapa¼¼æsa Pæ¹i.
3. Paribbæjaka Vagga.
6. Sandaka Sutta, Para. 228.

77

whereas the Buddha was the exception. Even if the Buddha's disciples
left the Order, they did not find fault with the Buddha nor the Dhamma.
They only blamed themselves for not being able to follow his Teaching.
Udæyø attributed this difference in reverential respect enjoyed by the
Buddha to five aspects of his virtues. The Buddha rejected Udæyø's
enumeration of his virtues which were mostly attributed to ascetic
practices, and explained to him the real cause of the total veneration
bestowed on him by his followers.
(8) Sama¼amu¼ðika Sutta
The wandering ascetic Uggahamana, son of Sama¼amu¼ðika, was
teaching that any recluse who refrained from wrong deed, wrong word,
wrong thought, and wrong livelihood was a fully accomplished Arahat.
The Buddha rejected his assertion, saying that in that case, even an infant
sleeping innocently upon his bed could claim to Arahatship. He then
explained that it was only the Noble Path of Eight Constituents leading to
Right Knowledge and Right Liberation that could bring about realization
of Arahatship.
(9) Cþ¹asakuludæyi Sutta
This discourse was given at Ræjagaha. The wandering ascetic
Sakuludæyi asked the Buddha many questions about atta and søla, and the
Buddha explained to him the practice in the Teaching beginning with the
precept of not taking the life of a being and ending with the realization of
Nibbæna.
(10) Vekhanasa Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi. The Buddha explained to
Vekhanasa, the wandering ascetic, how happiness accruing from spiritual
attainments was superior to that derived from sensuous pleasures. The
Buddha also gave the assurance that any honest worker who would
follow his instructions sincerely could enjoy the bliss of spiritual
attainments.

78

IV. Ræja Vagga
(1) Gha¥ikæra Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha while journeying in Kosala,
recounts the story of high devotion of Gha¥ikæra, the potter, who looked
after his blind parents and who at the same time attended upon Kassapa
Buddha with utter reverence. There was also the account of how
Gha¥ikæra forcibly pulled along his friend, young Jotipæla, to where
Kassapa Buddha was, to pay respect. After hearing the dhamma
discourses young Jotipæla left the household life to be admitted into the
Order by Kassapa Buddha. This interesting ancient episode that had
happened in Kassapa Buddha's time many aeons ago was recounted to
the Venerable Ænanda by Gotama Buddha standing on the very spot
where once stood, a long, long time ago, the house of Gha¥ikhæra, the
potter. The Buddha concluded his story by revealing that young Jotipæla
was none other than the present Gotama Buddha.
(2) Ra¥¥hapæla Sutta
Ra¥¥hapæla, the son of a wealthy brahmin obtained his parents'’
permission with great difficulty to become a bhikkhu under the guidance
of the Buddha. After twelve years of strenuous endeavour, when he
became a full-fledged Arahat, he visited his parents' home. His parents
attempted to entice him with wealth and wife back to household life but
to no avail. He taught his parents the law of impermanence, anicca; he
said he saw nothing alluring in the wealth and the wife.
(3) Maghadeva Sutta
This discourse was given at the Royal mango grove at Mithilæ. The
Buddha told the Venerable Ænanda about the noble tradition laid down
by the righteous King Maghadeva. When his hair began to turn white, he
gave up the household life leaving his dominions to his eldest son. This
tradition was handed down from king to son for generations and
generations, over thousands and thousands of years until the reign of
King Nimi.
King Nimi had a son by the name of Ka¹ærajanaka who did not go
forth from home life into homelessness when the time came like his
predecessors. Ka¹ærajanaka terminated the noble practice laid down by
the tradition. He thus became the last person of that tradition.

79

The Buddha revealed that he was the King Maghadeva of that
ancient time laying down the noble tradition. The Buddha said that that
noble tradition did not lead to calm, to higher knowledge. It only led to
the realm of Brahmæs. But the noble practice which he was leading now
as a Buddha certainly led to the disillusionment with the five khandhas,
the abandonment of attachment and the cessation of dukkha; to calm,
higher knowledge, penetrative insight and realization of Nibbæna. The
Buddha then exhorted, "Ænanda, continue to follow this good practice
which I have laid down. Let you not be the person with whom my
tradition ends."
(4) Madhura Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Mahækaccæna at
Madhura. He refuted the brahmins' claim that only brahmins were noble
and superior, and that others were inferior. He explained to King
Madhura that it was one's morality, not birth that established one's
nobility. Anyone whether Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa or Sudda, committing a wrong deed would be born again in the states of woe; anyone doing
a good deed would be born again in a happy realm. After this discourse
by the Venerable Mahækaccæna, King Madhura, formerly of another
faith, took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha.
(5) Bodhiræjakumæra Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Susumæragira in the
country of Bhagga in connection with the statement made by Prince
Bodhi that "sukha, happiness, cannot be attained through sukha; sukha
can be attained only through dukkha". The Buddha said he had also once
thought in a similar manner, and recounted the whole story of his
renunciation, his struggles with wrong practices, frantic search for the
Truth, and ultimate enlightenment. When asked by the prince how long
would it take a bhikkhu to achieve, in this very lifetime, the supreme goal
of the holy life, Arahatship, the Buddha stipulated five attributes for the
aspiring bhikkhu. If he was equipped with five attributes: faith, good
health, integrity (not being deceitful), unrelenting zeal, and sufficient
intellect to understand the phenomena of 'arising and passing away', and
having the Tathægata as his instructor and guide, a bhikkhu would
achieve the Arahatship within seven years at most. Under the most favourable circumstances he could become accomplished within half a day.

80

(6) A³gulimæla Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha at Sævatthi, describes how
A³gulimæla, the notorious robber and murderer, was tamed by the
Buddha, and how he took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
Saµgha. Although he had the name of Ahiµsaka, Non-violence, he was
formerly cruel and murderous and was called A³gulimæla by people.
Being tamed now by the Buddha, he ceased hurting anyone, and started
living a life true to his name. He had become an Arahat.
(7) Piyajætika Sutta
A householder of Sævatthi whose son had died went to see the
Buddha who told him that dear beloved ones formed a source of sorrow
as they brought pain and grief. The householder was displeased with
what the Buddha said. Gamblers playing with dice just close by the
Buddha's monastery told him differently. They said that loved ones
surely brought joy and happiness. King Pasenadi concurred with the
gamblers but his queen Mallikæ maintained that only what the Buddha
said must be true. She justified her faith in the Buddha by giving many
illustrations of the Buddha's penetrating and illuminating wisdom. King
Pasenadi was finally won over to her view.
(8) Bæhitika Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi by the Venerable Ænanda to
King Pasenadi on the bank of the River Aciravatø. He dealt with
unwholesome deeds, words and thoughts which were blameworthy and
wholesome deeds, words and thoughts which were praiseworthy. King
Pasenadi was pleased with the discourse and made a gift of cloth from the
country of Bæhiti to the Venerable Ænanda.
(9) Dhammacetiya Sutta
King Pasenadi of Kosala once came to see the Buddha. Entering the
dwelling where the Buddha was staying, he fell on his forehead at the
feet of the Buddha. When asked by the Buddha why he was showing
such extreme humbleness and respect to the body of the Buddha, the king
launched eloquently on a eulogy of the Buddha, praising his virtues. The
Buddha told his bhikkhus that the words uttered by the king constituted a
memorial in honour of the Dhamma and urged them to learn this
memorial and recite it frequently.

81

(10) Ka¼¼akatthala Sutta
This discourse, given by the Buddha at Uruññæ, contains answers to
King Pasenadi Kosala's questions about four classes of people and their
destinations after death, about Sabbaññuta Ñæ¼a, and about the great Brahmæ.

V. Bræhma¼a Vagga
(1) Brahmæyu Sutta
The Brahmin Brahmæyu was one hundred and twenty years old
when he heard of the fame of the Buddha. He sent his disciple Uttara who
was well versed in Vedas to find out by examining the thirty-two
physical characteristics of a great man whether Gotama was indeed an
Enlightened Buddha. On Uttara's good report testifying to the Buddha
having the requisite characteristics of a Buddha, Brahmæyu went himself
to see the Buddha. Fully satisfied, after hearing the graduated discourse,
that Gotama was indeed an enlightened Buddha, he became a devoted
disciple and, achieving the third stage of the Path and Fruition, an
Anægæmø before he passed away.
(2) Sela Sutta
Sela was a brahmin of Æpa¼a market-town, who on hearing about
the fame of the Buddha from Ke¼iya the hermit went to see the Buddha
accompanied by three hundred young brahmins. After hearing a
discourse from the Buddha he became fully convinced that he had indeed
seen a truly enlightened Buddha. All of them requested for and received
permission from the Buddha to join the Order.
(3) Assalæyana Sutta
Some five hundred brahmins who had come to Sævatthi on business
attempted to challenge the Buddha on his views with regard to the purity
and nobility of the four classes of people. They sent Assalæyana, a highly
talented young man well-versed in the Vedas, to contest with the Buddha.
The young man's meeting with the Buddha ended up in his conversion.

82

(4) Gho¥amukha Sutta
A discussion took place between the Venerable Udena and a
brahmin by the name of Gho¥amukha on the subject of the practice of the
holy life. The Venerable Udena described four kinds of persons engaged
in ascetic practices. After the discourse the Brahmin became a disciple of
the Venerable Udena and took his refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and
the Saµgha.
(5) Ca³kø Sutta
Ca³kø, a brahmin of Opæsæda Village, came to see the Buddha with
a large crowd amongst whom was a young brahmin by the name of
Kæpæ¥ika. The young man entered into a discussion with the Buddha
about the 'Three Vedas' which had been handed down from generation to
generation in unbroken tradition. The tradition which the brahmins
believed to be the only Truth was likened by the Buddha to a line of blind
men each one clinging on to the preceding one.
(6) Esukærø Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi in connection with a brahmin
named Esukærø. In this sutta too the Buddha rejected the brahmin
classification of society into four classes claiming the highest position for
the brahmins. It was not only the brahmins who could develop lovingkindness, free from enmity and ill will. Members of other classes also
could develop loving-kindness. It was not birth but the practice of
wholesome dhamma that made a person noble.
(7) Dhanañjæni Sutta
Dhanañjæni was an old devoted lay disciple of the Buddha. After
the death of his first wife who had great faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Saµgha, he was no longer diligent in and mindful of the practice
of dhamma. His second wife was without faith in the Teaching of the
Buddha. To maintain his family he resorted to wrongful means of
livelihood. The Venerable Særiputta put him back on the right path. On
his deathbed, he sent for the Venerable Særiputta who solaced him with
the dhamma. This caused him on his death to be reborn in the Brahma
world. The Buddha asked the Venerable Særiputta why he had put the old
brahmin only on the way to the inferior Brahma world when a higher
attainment was possible for him.

83

(8) Væse¥¥ha Sutta
A discussion had arisen between two brahmin youths Væse¥¥ha and
Bhæradvæja on the origin of a bræhma¼a. Bhæradvæja maintained it was
birth, lineage and caste that made a person a bræhma¼a. Væse¥¥ha
believed moral conduct and performance of customary duties were
essential qualifications to be a bræhma¼a. They went to the Buddha for
settlement of their dispute.
The Buddha told them that a person was not a bræhma¼a just
because of his birth if he was full of worldly attachments, or was
harnessed to greed, ill will, craving, and ignorance. A person became a
bræhma¼a whatever his birth, when he had cut off his fetters of defilements, removed the obstacles of ignorance and attained the knowledge of
the Four Noble Truths. The most perfect bræhma¼a was an Arahat.
(9) Subha Sutta
This discourse was given on account of Subha, son of the brahmin
Todeyya, at Sævatthi. Like other brahmins, Subha believed that only
householders could accomplish meritorious deeds in a right manner, not
those who had gone forth from the household life. The occupation of
householders produced great benefits whereas the occupation of the
recluse brought little benefits. The Buddha removed his wrong views and
Subha became a devoted disciple of the Buddha.
(10) Sa³gærava Sutta
Sa³gærava was a young brahmin who was full of pride with
learning in the Vedas, entertaining wrong views of his birth. He went to
ask the Buddha whether the Buddha claimed, like some sama¼as and
bræhma¼as, to have attained in this very life, special knowledge and
vision, and reached the other shore. The Buddha explained that there
were three kinds of sama¼as and bræhma¼as who made such claims:
those who made the claim through hearsay, having learnt things by
hearsay only; those who made the claim by mere reasoning and logic;
and finally those who made the claim by personally realizing the
penetrative insight of the Dhamma unheard of before.
The Buddha told Sa³gærava that he was of this third type and
recounted how he had become accomplished in the dhamma by practice
and self-realization.

(c) Uparipa¼¼æsa Pæ¹i
1. Devadaha Vagga
(1) Devadaha Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Devadaha in the country
of the Sakyans to refute the wrong views of the Niga¼¥has. The
Niga¼¥has believed that whatever a person experienced in this life was
caused by former action. They practiced austerity as a penance to put an
end to the result of former action. The Buddha taught them the right path
that would lead to the end of suffering.
(2) Pañcattaya Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha to bhikkhus at Sævatthi to
explain the wrong beliefs of other sects speculating on whether the world
is finite or infinite, etc.
(3) Kinti Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Pisinæræ. The Buddha
explained that he taught the dhamma not for the sake of gain, such as
robes, alms-food, lodgings, etc., nor in expectation of future happy
existences. His teachings, namely, the Four Methods of Steadfast
Mindfulness, the Four Right Efforts, etc., in short, the Thirty-seven
Factors of Enlightenment were for the attainment of higher knowledge
leading to the end of suffering. Whenever there was a dispute ever the
doctrine with regard to meanings and words, it should be resolved strictly
in accordance with these dhammas.
(4) Sæmagæma Sutta
Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta had recently died at Pævæ and his followers had
split into two groups. On being informed by Ænanda that he was worried
lest there be such a schism among the Order, after the passing away of
the Buddha, the Buddha taught this discourse on imperfect and perfect
teachers and disciples, on disputes and their origin, and on the essentials
of his Teaching.

85

(5) Sunakkhatta Sutta
Bhikkhu Sunakkhatta, a former Licchavø prince, once enquired of
the Buddha whether all the bhikkhus who came to the Buddha and
declared their attainment of Arahatship actually attained it. The Buddha
said some of them actually did attain Arahatship whereas some deceived
themselves; again others claimed Arahatship, knowing full well that they
were not entitled to it, simply to trouble him with unnecessary questions.
The Buddha then taught him the essential dhammas in which one must
become accomplished before one could claim Arahatship.
(6) Æneñja-sappæya Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha while he was staying once
at Kammæsadhamma, in the country of the Kurus. The Buddha explained
to the bhikkhus the dangers of enjoying sensual pleasures, which were
transitory, empty and deceptive. He said he had shown them the path
leading to imperturbability (Æneñja-sappæya), to the realm of
Nothingness, to the realm of Neither Consciousness Nor NonConsciousness, and ultimately to Nibbæna. He then urged the bhikkhus:
"Go to the forest, to solitude. Strive hard in meditation."
(7) Ga¼akamoggallæna Sutta
The Buddha was once asked by the Brahmin Ga¼aka Moggallæna
whether there were systematic rules, practices and methods in his
Teaching, just as there were training rules, manuals, guidances in various
branches of worldly knowledge. The Buddha told him about the Dhamma
giving details about precepts to be observed, disciplinary rules to be
followed, various concentrations to be developed and jhænas and paññæs
to be achieved step by step.
(8) Gopakamoggallæna Sutta
Two leading brahmins of Ræjagaha asked the Venerable Ænanda
whether the Buddha had appointed a particular there to be the head of the
Saµgha after he passed away. Ænanda informed them there was no such
person. No person could substitute the Buddha. They wanted to know
then if the Saµgha had agreed upon a certain bhikkhu to be their head.
When Ænanda told them there was no such person, they wondered how
the Saµgha could remain in agreement and unity. Ænanda then explained
to them that they had indeed refuge in the Dhamma and how the Saµgha

86

of each locality recited together the Pætimokkha, the summary of
disciplinary rules, every half month.
(9) Mahæpu¼¼ama Sutta
The Buddha was sitting in the midst of a large number of bhikkhus
out in the open on a full moon night. All the bhikkhus were intently
engaged in meditation. The silence of the night was broken by the oldest
of the meditating bhikkhus who, with the permission of the Buddha,
asked him about the five aggregates of grasping, how craving developed
with respect to each aggregate, and how craving would cease. The
Buddha explained each point raised by the bhikkhu to the great benefit of
the assembled Saµgha.
(10) Cþ¹apu¼¼ama Sutta
This discourse was given on how to differentiate between a good
man and a bad man, with detailed description of the characteristics of
good and bad men.
II. Anupada Vagga
(1) Anupada Sutta
This discourse was given at Sævatthi. The Buddha brought out in
full detail the virtues of one of his two Chief Disciples, the Venerable
Særiputta, extolling his wisdom which was extensive like the big earth,
describing how, unlike other ordinary disciples who had attained
Arahatship, the Venerable Særiputta went through the practices for
development of søla, samædhi and paññæ in a very thorough manner, step
by step, contemplating very intensely on the minutest phenomenon of
'arising and perishing' until he gained the highest goal of the holy life.
The Buddha explained also how the Venerable Særiputta was fully
accomplished in the Dhamma to deserve the honour of being a Chief
Disciple of the Buddha.
(2) Chabbisodhana Sutta
The Buddha said that when any bhikkhu claimed to the attainment
of Arahatship, his claim should not be admitted or rejected outright. His
claim should be carefully scrutinized according to the guiding principles
provided in this discourse.

87

(3) Sappurisa Sutta
This describes how a good, worthy man is to be distinguished from
a bad, unworthy person enumerating twenty-six characteristics by which
each individual is to be judged.
(4) Sevitabbæsevitabba Sutta
This discourse was given briefly by the Buddha, and the Venerable
Særiputta continued to expound it in more detail. It deals with practices
and actions which a bhikkhu should or should not resort to. Whatever
action or practice or object is conducive to one's spiritual progress and
development should be resorted to and made use of; whatever is
detrimental to one's spiritual advancement should be rejected.
(5) Bahudhætuka Sutta
This discourse is an analytical study of elements, dhætu; bases,
æyatana; the law of dependent origination; and the right or wrong causes.
Only the bhikkhu skilled in these studies may be reckoned as a wise person.
6) Isigili Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Isigili, one of the hills
surrounding Ræjagaha. This is an account of why this hill was called by
that name and of the many Paccekabuddhas who used to dwell there.
(7) Mahæcattærøsaka Sutta
This discourse is a detailed exposition on Right Concentration
which has its base in the other seven constituent parts of the Noble Path,
on twenty meritorious dhammas and on twenty demeritorious dhammas.
(8) Ænæpænassati Sutta
Ænæpænassati as a method of meditation was explained to a large
gathering of bhikkhus including nearly all well-known senior disciples
such as the Venerable Særiputta, Mahæ Moggallæna, Mahæ Kassapa,
Anuruddha, Ænanda etc. Development of mindfulness of respiration
establishes a person in the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness. The
Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness, being developed, establishes a
person in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. The Seven Factors of

88

Enlightenment, being developed, bring about Insight Knowledge and
emancipation.
(9) Kæyagatæsati Sutta
This discourse describes the meditation practice involving
contemplation on the thirty-two parts of the body. The practical steps in
the method as well as its advantages are fully explained.
(10) Sa³khærupapatti Sutta
This discourse explains how it is possible to have one's wish
fulfilled if one is well established in the five wholesome dhammas,
namely, faith, moral conduct, learning, liberality and wisdom.
III. Suññata Vagga
(1) Cþ¹asuññata Sutta
The Buddha once told Ænanda that he often dwelt in the liberation
of the void, Suññata-vihæra. When requested by Ænanda, he explained
what liberation of the void meant — Liberation through Insight that
discerns voidness of self.
(2) Mæhasuññata Sutta
Seeing many bhikkhus living together in a crowded dwelling place,
the Buddha told Ænanda that a bhikkhu should not like living in
company. Solitude is most beneficial for a bhikkhu. He urged bhikkhus to
look upon him as a sincere friend who would repeatedly point out their
faults to help correct them.
(3) Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta
This discourse is an account of the twenty marvellous attributes of
the Buddha as extolled by the Venerable Ænanda.
(4) Bækula Sutta
Bhikkhu Bækula, aged one hundred and sixty years, met his old
friend, the naked ascetic Kassapa, after he had been in the Order of the

89

Buddha for eighty years. Kassapa asked him how often he had indulged
in sexual intercourse during those eighty years. Bækula told his friend the
marvellous attributes he possessed as an Arahat, including the fact that he
became an Arahat after seven days of strenuous endeavour, after which
he was completely rid of moral defilements.
(5) Dantabhþmi Sutta
In this discourse the Buddha explained to the novice Aciravata how
a young prince like Prince Jayasena, son of King Bimbisæra could not
hope to know, to see, to realize such dhammas as concentration and
jhænas, living as he did in the lap of luxury, surrounded by pleasures of
senses, enjoying the pleasures of senses and consumed and overwhelmed
by the flames of desires. The Buddha pointed out the difference in
outlook between an Arahat and an ordinary uninstructed person giving
the simile of a tamed elephant and a wild elephant of the forest.
(6) Bhþmija Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Bhþmija to his nephew,
Prince Jayasena to explain how Fruition would result by practising the
Noble Path of Eight Constituents. The Buddha confirmed that only by
following the right Path, namely, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents
and not any other Path, Fruition would result. The Buddha gave the
similes of attempting to make oil out of sand, squeezing the horns of a
cow for milk, churning water to make butter, and rubbing two pieces of
wet green wood to make fire.
(7) Anuruddha Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Anuruddha to
Pañcaka³ga, the carpenter, to explain the difference between Appamæ¼a
Cetovimutti, liberation through practice of four Brahmavihæra
Meditation and Mahaggata Cetovimutti, liberation through Kasi¼a
Meditation using a meditational device.
(8) Upakkilesa Sutta
Once the Buddha left Kosambø because of quarrelling, contentious
bhikkhus and went to Pæcinavaµsa Park where the Venerable
Anuruddha, the Venerable Nandiya and the Venerable Kimila were

90

staying. When these bhikkhus informed the Buddha about the aura
(obhæsa) and vision (dassana) of various shapes and forms they perceived
in the course of their meditation, the Buddha taught them about
Upakkilesa, mental defilements, that appear at a certain stage in
meditation process. They should be on their guard not to be led astray by
these deceptive defilements.
(9) Bælapa¼ðita Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha at Sævatthi on fools and
characteristic behaviour of fools; on how evil thoughts, words and deeds
of fools harm themselves and others; and on how these evil actions lead
fools to states of misery and woe. The utter wretchedness and intense
suffering in such states beggar description. Once a fool, through his evil
actions, found himself in one of the nether regions, there was very little
likelihood for him to rise again to the upper realms. The chances are
more remote than that of a blind turtle to get his head through a single
hole in a yoke which was being tossed about in a stormy sea.
The discourse deals also with the wise and their characteristics; the
wholesome thoughts, words and deeds of the wise, the wholesome effects
resulting from such meritorious actions and bliss enjoyed by them in the
realms of happiness.
(10) Devadþta Sutta
This is a discourse on evil results arising from evil action, giving
details of suffering in realms of misery and woe.

IV. Viba³ga Vagga
(1) Bhaddekaratta Sutta
This sutta which means 'a discourse on a night of good meditation'
gives a detailed description of Vipassanæ meditation. The Buddha urged
the bhikkhus not to dwell in the past which was gone, nor to seek the
future which was unattained yet, but to perceive the dhamma in the
phenomena presently occurring, at the same time not becoming involved
in and attached to them.

91

(2) Ænanda-bhaddekaratta Sutta
This is a discourse in which the Venerable Ænanda repeated to the
bhikkhus the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, for which performance he was highly
commended by the Buddha.
(3) Mahækaccæna-bhaddekaratta Sutta
This is a detailed exposition by the Venerable Mahækaccæna on
Vipassanæ meditation of the five khandhas as explained by the Buddha in
the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. The Venerable Mahækaccæna was commended
by the Buddha for his exposition.
(4) Lomasaka³giya-bhaddekaratta Sutta
This is a detailed exposition by the Venerable Lomasaka³giya on
Vipassanæ meditation of the five khandhas explained in the
Bhaddekaratta Sutta.
(5) Cþ¹akamma-vibha³ga Sutta
Young Subha, son of the Brahmin Todeyya, was curious to know
why some were born in high class families, some in low class families;
why some were born rich, others poor; why some were beautiful, others
ugly; why some were of good health with a long span of life, others of
poor health with a short span of life, etc. He approached the Buddha and
asked fourteen questions in all to satisfy his curiosity. The Buddha gave a
long discourse on kamma and its resultant effects. Deeds, words and
thoughts have endless consequences of joy and sorrow to be experienced
in this very life and hereafter. Men depend on their own deeds and
nothing else for their condition and status in life.
(6) Mahækamma-vibha³ga Sutta
This is another discourse on kamma and its resultant effects which
are most difficult to foresee. How the workings of kamma were most
strange and surprising were explained with reference to four types of
individuals.

92

(7) Sa¹æyatana-vibha³ga Sutta
This discourse is a detailed analytical exposition on six internal
sense bases, six external sense bases, six types of consciousness arising
from six types of contact, etc., by the Buddha.
(8) Uddesa-vibha³ga Sutta
In this discourse, the Buddha taught briefly how restraint of the mind
with regard to external sense bases and non-attachment to internal sense
bases led to the cessation of suffering. The Venerable Kaccæna gave an
exposition on this subject which earned him praise from the Buddha.
(9) Ara¼a-vibha³ga Sutta
This discourse is an exhortation on the practice of the Middle Path,
avoiding the two extremes of indulgence in sensual pleasures and
practice of self-mortification, and on modes of conduct, not indulging in
backbiting; not keeping to colloquial vocabulary only and not spurning
the conventional usage of the language, but speaking gently, slowly.
(10) Dhætu-vibha³ga Sutta
This is an important discourse taught to Pukkusæti, a recluse who
had left the homelife inspired by the fame of Gotama Buddha whom he
had not yet met and whom he was on his way to see. The Buddha went
purposely to meet this recluse in a potter's hut to teach this discourse: A
man is made up of six elements, namely, solidity, fluidity, heat, motion,
space and consciousness. On analysis, none of these elements is found to
be 'mine' or 'me' or 'my self '. All of them are subject to the law of
impermanence, so are the three types of sensation. When a bhikkhu
perceives the real nature of the physical and mental phenomena, he
becomes endowed with absolute wisdom, Knowledge of the Noble Truth.
(11) Sacca-vibha³ga Sutta
In this discourse the Buddha taught the bhikkhus the Four Noble
Truths as he had done at the time of giving the discourse on the Turning
of the Wheel of Dhamma at Isipatana in Bæræ¼asø. He then urged the
bhikkhus to seek guidance from the two theras, the Venerable Særiputta
and the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna, likening the Venerable Særiputta to
a mother and the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna to a foster-mother. The

93

Venerable Særiputta could analyse and explain the Four Noble Truths in
detail and lead them to the stage of the first Path and Fruition. The
Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna could then lead them on till the highest Path
and Fruition, the Arahatship, was achieved.
(12) Dakkhi¼æ-vibha³ga Sutta
This discourse was given to the Buddha's foster-mother
Mahæpajæpati on the occasion of her offering to the Buddha a set of robes
made by her own hand. The Buddha urged his foster-mother to make the
offering to the Saµgha, the community of bhikkhus. He enumerated
fourteen kinds of donations to individuals and seven kinds of donations to
the Saµgha, explaining the superior benefit accruing from offerings
made to the Saµgha.

V. Sa¹æyatana Vagga
(1) Anæthapi¼ðikovæda Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Særiputta to
Anæthapi¼ðika on his death-bed. The Venerable Særiputta enjoined him
not to grasp at the six internal sense bases, nor the six external sense
bases, nor the feelings that arise in relation to them, nor at the six
elements (including space and consciousness), nor at the five aggregates,
nor the realms of Infinite Space, of Infinite Consciousness, of
Nothingness, of Neither Consciousness Nor Non-Consciousness. With no
attachment to any of them, there would come liberation.
(2) Channovæda Sutta
The Venerable Channa was very ill. The Venerable Særiputta and
Cunda paid him a visit. They gave him solace by giving instruction on
Vipassanæ meditation. The Venerable Channa died an Arahat.
(3) Pu¼¼ovæda Sutta
This discourse was given to Bhikkhu Pu¼¼a by the Buddha on how
to practise the holy life in solitude. When the Buddha asked him how he
would contend with the dangers which infested the locality where he was

94

going to stay, he told the Buddha of the six categories of fortitude he was
endowed with, including indifference to an attack even on his life.
(4) Nandakovæda Sutta
This discourse was given by the Venerable Nandaka to five hundred
bhikkhunøs in the presence of the Buddha one full moon night. He dealt
with the twelve categories of internal and external sense bases, the six
types of consciousness, their impermanent nature and how to practice the
Seven Factors of Enlightenment. He won the approval of the Buddha for
his lucid exposition of the Dhamma.
(5) Cþ¹aræhulovæda Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha to his son Ræhula who was
then a bhikkhu of the Order fully mature to receive the highest dhamma.
The Buddha exhorted him, in the form of questions and answers on the
impermanent nature of the twelve sense bases, in consequence of which
the Venerable Ræhula attained to Arahatship.
(6) Chachakka Sutta
This discourse was given by the Buddha frequently to many
bhikkhus on the six internal sense bases, the six external sense bases, six
types of consciousness, six types of contacts, six types of sensation, six
kinds of craving and on how their interrelationship led to continuity of
phenomena from one existence to another.
(7) Mahæsa¹æyatanika Sutta
This discourse is an exposition on how the ignorance of the six
categories of dhamma such as the six internal sense bases, etc., gives rise
to craving, and craving to suffering. It also explains how, when they are
seen as they really are by following the Noble Path of Eight Constituents,
the knowledge of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment arises resulting in
the perfect Peace of Nibbæna.
(8) Nagaravindeyya Sutta
This is a discourse in which the Buddha explained to the villagers of
Nagaravinda the distinction between sama¼as and bræhma¼as who

95

deserved honour and homage and those who did not. Only those religious
teachers who had discarded the craving that arose out of æyatana
dhammas were worthy of veneration.
(9) Pi¼ðapætapærisuddhi Sutta
This is an exhortation to bhikkhus to keep themselves pure in mind
while going on alms round or while eating their meal, by discarding
craving, removing hindrances and developing the knowledge of the
Seven Factors of Enlightenment through continuous practice.
(10) Indriyabhævanæ Sutta
This discourse was given to the Venerable Ænanda by the Buddha
showing the difference between the control of senses practised by an
Arahat and that practised by one still under training. The Buddha
explained that feelings of liking, disliking or of indifference that arise
from conditioned phenomena could be soon eliminated by the practice of
Vipassanæ Meditation.

96

Chapter VI.
Saµyutta Nikæya
This collection of discourses in the Suttanta Pi¥aka known as
Saµyutta Nikæya has 7762 suttas of varied length, generally short,
arranged in a special order according to subject matter into five major
divisions: (a) Sagæthæ Vagga, (b) Nidæna Vagga, (c) Khandha Vagga,
(d) Sa¹æyatana Vagga and (e) Mahæ Vagga. Each major vagga is divided
into fifty-six groups known as saµyuttas — related subjects grouped
together. The saµyuttas are named after the subjects they deal with, for
example, Bojjha³ga Saµyutta on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, or
after some principal personalities such as the Venerable Særiputta, King
Pasenadi of Kosala, or Sakka. Kosala Saµyutta is a group of discourses
concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala, and Devata Saµyutta deals with
devas like Sakka, Indra, Brahmæ, etc. Each saµyutta is further divided
into sections which are made up of individual suttas. Thus the wellknown Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is the first discourse (sutta) in the
second section of Sacca Saµyutta which comes under the Mahævagga
division of Saµyutta Nikæya. In the following excerpts from Saµyutta
Nikæya, only a few suttas representing each major division are given.

(a) Sagæthæ Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
This major division of Sagæthæ Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i contains eleven
saµyuttas with discourses grouped according to characters appearing in
them, the king of devas, the devas, the Brahmæ, Mæra, King of Kosala,
bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs. The name of the Vagga, Sagæthæ, is derived
from the fact that various personalities appearing in the discourses
conducted their dialogues or interviews with the Buddha mostly in verse.

Devatæ Saµyutta
On the request of a Brahmæ, the Buddha explains in the Oghatara¼a
Sutta of this saµyutta that he crosses over the flood of sensuous desire, of
existence, of wrong views and of ignorance neither by remaining
inactive, nor by making strenuous efforts. By remaining inactive he will
be sucked into the whirlpool; by making frantic efforts he will be swept
away in the current of the flood. He follows a middle course.

97

The Buddha also teaches in other suttas of this saµyutta that all
beings are entangled in the mesh of attachments brought about by six
internal sense bases and six external sense objects. The way to escape
from these entanglements is to become established in søla, to develop
Concentration Meditation and Insight Meditation in order to be fully
accomplished in the higher knowledge of liberation.
Until one becomes fully developed in the knowledge of the Path,
tanhæ can still give rise to rebirth. This fact is borne out by the story of a
deva named Sama¼a, given in Accharæ Sutta. A certain young man
having faith in the Teaching of the Buddha gets himself admitted into the
Order. Then taking a meditation subject of his choice, he repairs to a
solitary abode in the forest and devotes himself incessantly to the practice
of meditation.
His efforts at meditation are very strenuous. Thus striving day and
night and getting enervated by lack of sufficient nourishing food, he is
suddenly seized with a paralytic stroke which causes him instant death.
Although he has put in a great deal of effort in the practice of meditation,
he passes away without even attaining the stage of Sotæpanna, the
Stream-winner.
Because of tanhæ which he has not yet eradicated, he has to go
through the round of existences again; but in consequence of the merit he
has acquired in the practice of meditation, a magnificent celestial palace
awaits him in the celestial abode of the Tævatiµsa.
By spontaneous manifestation, he appears as if just awakened from
sleep, at the entrance of the palace, a celestial being resplendent in full
celestial attire. He does not realize that he has taken a new existence in a
new world. He thinks he is still a bhikkhu of the human world. The
celestial maidens, who are awaiting his arrival, bring a body-length
mirror and place it in front of the deva. On seeing his reflection in the
mirror, he finally realizes that he has left the bhikkhus' existence and has
arisen in the celestial realm.
The Sama¼a Deva is greatly perturbed then. He reflects that he has
taken up meditation not to be reborn in the celestial land but to attain the
goal of Arahatta Fruition. So without entering the palatial building, he
repairs hastily to the presence of the Buddha. He asks of the Buddha how
to avoid, and proceed past the Mohana garden, the Tævatiµsa celestial
abode, full of celestial maidens who to him appear as demons. The
Buddha advises him that the straight path for a quick escape is the Noble
Path of Eight Constituents using the two-wheeler Vipassanæ carriage,
fitted with the two wheels of physical exertion and mental exertion.

98

While the Buddha is teaching the Dhamma in three verses, Sama¼a Deva
is able to develop quickly successive Vipassanæ Ñæ¼as step by step until
he attains the first Path and Fruition.

Devaputta Saµyutta
In Rohitassa Sutta of this saµyutta, Rohitassa Deva comes to the
Buddha with another problem. He tells the Buddha that he was in a
former existence a hermit endowed with supernormal psychic power
which enabled him to traverse throughout the universe with immense
speed. He had travelled with that speed for over one hundred years to
reach the end of the world but he did not succeed. He wants to know
whether it would be possible to know or see or reach the end of the world
where there is no birth nor death by travelling there. The Buddha says he
does not declare that there is a world's end where there is no birth nor
death to be known or seen or reached by travelling there. Yet he does not
say that there is an ending of suffering without reaching Nibbæna. It is in
the fathom long body of oneself with its perception and its mind that the
Buddha describes the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the
world and the way leading to the cessation of the world. The Buddha's
way leading to the cessation of the world is the Noble Path of Eight
Constituents.

Kosala Saµyutta
In this saµyutta are interesting suttas which describe frequent
meetings of the Buddha with King Pasenadi of Kosala. The king has
heard of the fame of the Buddha from his queen Mallikæ but has not yet
met him. But when at last he meets the Buddha as described in the
Dahara Sutta, he puts a direct question whether the Venerable Gotama
claims to have attained the Supreme Enlightenment. He says that there
are other religious teachers such as Pþra¼a Kassapa, Makkhali Gosæla,
Nigap¥ha Næ¥aputta, Sañcaya, Pakudha and Ajita, with their own order,
with their own followers, who are much older than the Buddha and are
generally regarded to be Arahats. Even these teachers do not make claim
to Supreme Enlightenment.
The Buddha replies that if it can be rightly said of anyone to have
attained the Supreme Enlightenment, then it is only of himself that it can

99

rightly be said. The Buddha adds that there are four things that should not
be looked down upon and despised because they are young. They are a
young prince, a serpent, a fire and a bhikkhu. A young prince of noble
parentage should not be despised. He might one day become a powerful
ruler and wreak royal vengeance. A writhing snake moves very fast; it
might attack and bite a heedless man. A small fire, when heedlessly
ignored might grow in intensity and cause untold damage. A man treating
a virtuous bhikkhu with contempt might bring upon himself
unwholesome results such as dwindling prosperity and lack of offspring
to inherit from him.
Dutiya Aputtaka Sutta describes another occasion when King
Pasenadi calls on the Buddha after he has just taken over an immense
accumulation of wealth belonging to a multi-millionaire who has died
recently. The dead man has left behind treasure worth over one hundred
lakhs which, in the absence of any heirs to claim, becomes the king's
property. The king reports that the dead millionaire was a great miser, a
niggardly person, begrudging even to himself the luxury of comfortable
living. He wore only very rough, thread-bare clothes, eating poor, coarse
food and travelled about in an old, roofless rickety carriage.
The Buddha confirms that what the king says about the millionaire
is quite true and tells the king the reason for the millionaire's miserliness.
In one of his past existences, he met a Paccekabuddha going round for
alms-food. He gave permission to his family to offer food to the
Paccekabuddha and went out to attend to some business. On his way
back, he met the Paccekabuddha whom he asked whether he had been
given any alms-food by his family, and looked into the bowl. On seeing
the delicious food in the bowl, an unwholesome thought suddenly arose
in his mind that it would have been more profitable to feed his servants
with such food than to give it away to a Paccekabuddha.
For his good deed of allowing his family to make the offering to a
Paccekabuddha he was reborn in the deva world seven times and became
a millionaire seven times in the human world. But as a result of the ill
thought he had entertained in that previous existence he never had the
inclination to live a luxurious life enjoying fine clothes, good food, and
riding in comfortable carriages.
The millionaire has now exhausted the good as well as the bad
effects of his thoughts and actions with regard to the offering of food to
the Paccekabuddha. But unfortunately he has to face the consequences of
a more serious evil deed, that of causing the death of his own nephew in a
past existence.

100

The Buddha tells the king that he is therefore reborn, after his death
in the human world, in the state of the most intense suffering,
Mahæroruva.

Bræhma¼a Saµyutta
Many brahmins of Bhæradvæja clan become devoted disciples of the
Buddha, ultimately attaining Arahatship. At first, all of them are quite
unfriendly, if not openly hostile. Bhæradvæja Gotta, mentioned in
Dhanañjænø Sutta, is such a brahmin. Although his wife Dhanañjænø is a
disciple of the Buddha, very much devoted to his Teaching, Bhæradvæja
Gotta and his brahmin teachers show great contempt for the Buddha and
his Teaching.
On one occasion when Bhæradvæja is giving a feast to his brahmin
teachers, his wife while in the course of waiting upon these brahmins
slips accidentally and, as she tries to regain her balance, blurts out three
times in excitement the formula of adoration to the Buddha: 'Namo Tassa
Bhagavato Arahato Sammæsambuddhassa'. Upon hearing the word
'Buddha', the brahmin teachers rise up from their seats and run away
helter-skelter in all directions just like a flock of crows in whose midst a
stone has been thrown.
Telling his wife in a fury that he would defeat the Buddha in a
contest of doctrines, Bhæradvæja goes to see the Buddha. The interview
ends up with Bhæradvæja asking the Buddha's permission to enter his
Order. He finally attains to Arahatship.
Akkosa Sutta mentions about Bhæradvæja Gotta's younger brother
Akkosaka Bhæradvæja, who on hearing that his elder brother has joined
the Buddha's Order is highly exasperated. Raging with fury, he storms
into the presence of the Buddha whom he reviles and reproaches in the
most vulgar, offensive, obscene, foul language.
Very calmly and with great compassion the Buddha asks the young
Bhæradvæja if he ever has given gifts to friends and relatives. When the
young Bhæradvæja replies that he indeed has made offers of gifts to his
friends and relatives, the Buddha asks him, "What happens to the gifts if
your friends and relatives do not accept them?"
"Well then they remain with me as my own property," replies
Bhæradvæja.

101

Then the Buddha says, "You have heaped abusive language on us
who have not uttered a single word of abuse to you; you have been very
offensive and quarrelsome with us who do not offend you nor quarrel
with you. Young Bhæradvæja, we do not accept your words of abuse, your
offensive and quarrelsome language. They remain with you as your own
property."
Taken by surprise by this unexpected reaction, Bhæradvæja is
frightened with the thought that this might be a recluse's method of
casting a spell on him by way of retaliation. He asks the Buddha if he is
angry with him for his rude behaviour. The Buddha states that he has
long left anger behind. Being free from all mental defilements how could
he take offence with him! To meet anger with anger is to sink lower than
the original reviler. He is the conqueror who wins a hard won battle by
not retaliating anger with anger.
At the end of the discourse, Akkosaka Bhæradvæja, the younger
brother, also leaves homelife to join the Buddha's Order. In time, he too
becomes accomplished in higher knowledge and attains to Arahatship.
In Kasi Bhæradvæja Sutta is an account of the Buddha's encounter
with the brahmin Kasi Bhæradvæja who is a rich landowner.
It is sowing time and Kasi Bhæradvæja is preparing to start
ploughing operations with five hundred ploughs. It is made an auspicious
occasion with distribution of food and with festivities. The Buddha goes
to where food is being distributed and stands at one side. Kasi
Bhæradvæja, seeing him waiting for food, says to him, "I plough, sama¼a,
and I sow. Having ploughed and sown, I eat. You too, sama¼a, should
plough and sow; having ploughed and sown, you shall eat."
The Buddha replies, "I too plough, brahmin, and I sow, and having
ploughed and sown, I eat."
"We see no yoke or plough or pole or oxen of yours. Yet you claim
to be a ploughman. How do you explain yourself?" asks the brahmin.
"The faith which I have had since the time of Sumedhæ, the hermit,
is the seed. It will grow to hear the fruit of Nibbæna. The søla with which I
keep control of my sense doors is the rain. The two kinds of knowledge,
mundane and supramundane, I possess are my plough and yoke. Sense of
shame for doing evil and fear of evil deeds are the pole and the handle of
the plough. My energy is the ox, and my concentration is the rope with
which I put the ox to the yoke. My mindfulness is the ploughshare and
the goad. Guarded in my speech and modest in the use of food, these selfrestraints serve as a fence round my field of Dhamma. With my

102

harnessed ox as my energy, I have ploughed on, never turning back until
the seed produces the fruit of Nibbæna, the Deathless. Having done such
ploughing, I eat now what I have sown and I am free from every kind of
suffering."
Kasi Bhæradvæja is so delighted and impressed with the Buddha's
words that he requests to be regarded as a disciple of the Buddha from
that day till the end of his life.
In Gaha¥¥havandana Sutta the Buddha explains that the brahmins
well versed in the Vedas as well as kings ruling over human dominions,
and devas of Cætumahæræjika and Tævatiµsa realm bow in homage to the
Sakka, the king of devas. The Sakka himself shows respect and makes
obeisance not only to sama¼as who have lived their holy life without any
breach of moral conduct for many years but also to the lay disciples of
the Buddha who are well established in their faith and who have done
meritorious deeds of giving charity, observing the Five, the Eight or the
Ten Precepts, and dutifully maintaining their families.

(b) Nidæna Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
This second major division of Nidæna Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
contains ten saµyuttas, all dealing, with fundamental aspects of the
doctrine. The discourses are chiefly concerned with the principles of
conditionality and interdependence, explained in the detailed formula
which is called 'Pa¥iccasamuppæda', Conditioned Genesis or Dependent
Origination, consisting of twelve factors.
Various aspects of Pa¥iccasamuppæda, together with expositions on
doctrinal matters concerning practice of the holy life form the main
theme of early suttas in these saµyuttas.

Nidæna Saµyutta
In Pa¥iccasamuppæda Sutta, the first sutta of this saµyutta, the law of
Dependent Origination outlined in the form of a formula is briefly explained
by the Buddha to five hundred bhikkhus who are perceived by the Buddha to
be sufficiently developed and ripe for the attainment to Arahatship. In the
Vibha³ga Sutta, the second sutta of this saµyutta, the law of Dependent
Origination is explained in fuller detail to the same bhikkhus.

103

In Pañcaverabhaya Sutta, the Buddha lays down the criteria by
which the status of attainment of a noble bhikkhu may be judged. If a
bhikkhu is freed of the five dangers arising from five evil deeds, namely,
killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, telling lies and taking intoxicating
liquor and drugs; if he is established in the four accomplishments of a
Sotæpanna, namely, firm faith and confidence in the virtues and attributes
of the Buddha, of the Dhamma and of the Saµgha, and perfect purity in
søla; and if he possesses comprehensive analytical knowledge of the law
of Dependent Origination, he is assured of a happy future, with no danger
of arising in states of woe and misery and is certain of further
advancement in the holy life.
In Puttamaµsþpama Sutta, it is explained that four nutriments,
æhæra, are 'conditions' necessary for the existence and continuity of
beings: (i) ordinary material food (kabaløkæræhæra), (ii) contact of sense
organs (phassa) with sense objects, (iii) consciousness (viññæ¼a), and
(iv) mental volitional or will (manosañcetanæ).
This sutta is addressed especially to young bhikkhus recently
admitted into the Order. They are enjoined to take their meals with due
reflection on the loathsome nature of food so as not to be overcome by
greed and attachment for it. A bhikkhu should take meals not with a view
to enjoy it or relish it, thereby augmenting craving, but just to sustain
himself in order that the holy life may be lived. A particularly
illuminating parable is used here by the Buddha: A man and his wife set
out on a very long journey accompanied by their beloved son. Half-way
on their journey they ran short of food. With no means of fresh supply,
they plodded on with starvation staring in their face. The little son soon
succumbed to hunger and died. The man and his wife decided to save
their lives by eating the flesh of their dead son. They ate with no relish
nor enjoyment but only to sustain themselves for the rest of the journey.
Other apt parables are given by the Buddha for the understanding of
the remaining three nutriments. When one understands the real nature of
nutriments on which life depends, one understands the craving, ta¼hæ,
responsible for all the suffering. Thereby the way is open to the supreme
liberation, the Arahatship.
Susima Paribbæjaka Sutta gives an account of the wandering ascetic
Susima who is one of those who join the Buddha's Order with ulterior
motives. After the rains residence many bhikkhus come to pay their
respect to the Buddha to whom they report their attainment of
Arahatship. When he learns from these Arahats that they possess no
supernormal powers such as the Divine Power of Vision, Divine Power

104

of Hearing, or Knowing Other People's Mind, he is very disappointed.
He has come into the Order just to acquire such powers with which to
win fame and gain for himself.
He approaches the Buddha and inquires how the bhikkhus could
claim Arahatship when they possess no supernormal powers. The Buddha
explains to him that their liberation is through pure Insight Knowledge,
not associated with jhæna accomplishments. Through Vipassanæ
meditation only they have seen the real nature of næma and rþpa (realities
of nature, Dhamma¥¥hiti) followed by realization of Nibbæna through
Magga Ñæ¼a.
The Buddha takes him through the same course of meditation,
testing by means of questions his understanding of the five khandhas,
their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, insubstantiality,
finally establishing in him the insight that none of these khandhas is to be
regarded as, "This is mine, this is I, this is my self ". At the end of the
discourse he gains full understanding of the Dhamma with the attainment
of Arahatship. When he realizes Arahatship himself without coming into
possession of the supernormal powers, he confesses to the Buddha the
ulterior motive with which he had first joined the Order, and begs to be
pardoned for such evil intentions.

Dhætu Saµyutta
The natural law of affinity is pointed out by the Buddha in the
Ca³kama Sutta of this saµyutta while he is staying at the Gijjhakþ¥a Hill
near Ræjagaha. He draws the attention of the bhikkhus to the scene
outside, where his senior disciples are taking a stroll attended upon by
their own group of followers. He says: "Bhikkhus, those many bhikkhus
under the leadership of the Venerable Særiputta are all wise being
endowed with much deep knowledge of the Dhamma. Those surrounding
the Venerable Mahæ Moggallæna are well accomplished in supernormal
powers. The Venerable Mahækassapa and his followers are strict
observers of Dhuta³ga austerity practices. The bhikkhus led by the
Venerable Anuruddha are fully endowed with the Divine Power of
Vision. The Venerable Pu¼¼a and his disciples are adepts at teaching the
Dhamma. The Venerable Upæli with his followers are experts in Vinaya
rules of discipline and the bhikkhus under Ænanda's guidance are noted
for their knowledge in many fields. Devadatta and his many followers are
distinguished by their evil ways, thoughts and desires. Bhikkhus, in this

105

way are beings grouped together in accordance with their natural bents
and tendencies. The law of affinity works in such a way that kindred
spirits flock together, those of evil disposition in one group, those of
wholesome inclinations in another. This law of affinity has held true in
the past, as it is true now and will be true in the future."

Anamatagga Saµyutta
In the various suttas of this saµyutta, the Buddha teaches that the
cycle of existence, the saµsæra, represents the continuous arising and
passing away of khandhas, æyatanas and dhætus. This incessant process
of evolution and dissolution of dhætus (the fundamental elements of
matter and mind) and khandhas (compounded of the dhætus) is endless.
Blinded by avijjæ, ignorance, and by nøvara¼as, hindrances, and fettered
by ta¼hæ, craving, beings have been passing from one existence to
another round and round the cycle of saµsæra, for immeasurable periods
of time. To bring home this fact of immensity of suffering undergone by
beings, the Buddha has given many similes in this saµyutta, most
illustrative of which are those of the four oceans and the Vepulla
Mountain given in the Assu Sutta. The tears shed through the ages by
each being on account of suffering due to disease, death, separation from
the loved ones, association with the unloved ones would fill the four
oceans to the brim. The bones left behind by a being after death in each
existence, if collected together at a certain place and preserved from loss
and decay, would be as high as the Vepulla Mountain which lies north of
the Gijjhakþ¥a Hill.
The only way to escape from this round of endless suffering is to
perceive the real nature of the khandhas by means of Vipassanæ
meditation until one becomes disenchanted with them; and thus by
abandoning craving for and attachment to them one attains liberation
through realization of Nibbæna.
The Buddha teaches in other suttas that one should in the
meanwhile develop loving-kindness towards all sentient beings with the
realization that, during the immeasurably long passage through the
saµsæra, there is no being who has not been one's mother, father, sister,
brother or one's son or daughter, relative or friend.

106

Kassapa Saµyutta
In the Candþpama Sutta of this saµyutta the Buddha lays down
codes of conduct for bhikkhus, giving the example of the moon. Just as
the moon sheds its light equally on every object or person so also a
bhikkhu should equally treat everyone, young or old or of middle age,
showing favouritism to none, nor hostility to any. He must deal with
them with due regard, humility and meekness. Mindfulness should be
ever present in his relations with all classes of people. For example, when
a certain person tries to obtain his drinking water from an old well or
from a riverbank of loose sand or from down a precipice, he approaches
the source of water with great care, controlling his movements and
actions. Much in the same way should a bhikkhu conduct himself with
great mindfulness in his dealings with all classes of people.
In teaching the Dhamma to lay disciples, if his motive is to win
gain and fame for himself, then his teaching should be regarded as
impure. The Dhamma should always be taught only out of compassion
and with pure thought so that the Dhamma which is excellent in the
beginning, excellent in the middle and excellent in the ending, namely,
the Dhamma on søla, samædhi and paññæ, could be heard, understood and
practised by the listener.
In the Saddhammappa¥irþpaka Sutta, the Buddha outlines the
conditions under which the Teaching would decline or under which it
would prosper. The Buddha gives the discourse in answer to a question
asked by the Venerable Mahækassapa why it is that in former days when
there were only a few disciplinary rules promulgated by the Buddha,
there were a large number of Arahats; now that the disciplinary rules
have multiplied, only a few attain to Arahatship.
The Buddha explains that the number of disciplinary rules
increases in proportion to the deterioration in the moral state of beings.
So long as no spurious and false teaching appears in the three branches of
the Teaching (pariyatti, theoretical learning; pa¥ipatti, practice; pa¥ivedha,
fruits of the practice), so long will the Teaching remain genuine, pure,
and untarnished. But when spurious and false teaching appears, this
Teaching with its three branches will decline gradually until it vanishes
altogether, much in the same way as genuine gold disappears when
imitation gold is introduced to take its place.
The Buddha concludes: "And Kassapa, just as iron is destroyed by
rust, it is the members of the Order who are corrupt, immoral, who
cannot hope to attain higher knowledge, who will bring about the
downfall of the Teaching."

107

In the last few suttas of Nidæna Vagga are discourses that describe
the fearful destiny of corrupt bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs and those lay
people who have done evil deeds in previous lives. The Venerable Mahæ
Moggallæna sees them suffering intensely in the Peta world and describes
their conditions vividly. The Buddha confirms what the Venerable
Moggallæna has recounted.

(c) Khandha Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
The main theme of most suttas in this division is, as the name
implies, khandhas, the five aggregates that constitute what is regarded as
a being. Each of the components of these aggregates, namely, matter,
sensation, perception, mental concomitants and consciousness is shown
to be a bundle of dukkha, suffering. Made up of thirteen saµyuttas,
Khandha Vagga forms an important collection of doctrinal discussions on
such topics as atta, anatta, eternity, and annihilation.
The Nakulapitu Sutta gives an account of the advice given to
Nakulapitæ, an ageing disciple of the Buddha. He asks for advice from
the Buddha on how to conduct and keep himself free from the pains of
old age and disease. The Buddha explains that rþpakkhandha, the
material body being a bundle of dukkha, is subjected constantly to the
pains of old age and disease; but the mental complex could be kept free
of agony and pain by keeping it undefiled with impurities. A more
detailed exposition of this brief explanation of the Buddha is given to
Nakulapitæ by the Venerable Særiputta. The uninstructed common
worldling clings to the five aggregates through craving and conceit, and
holds the wrong view that each of the aggregates (rþpa, vedanæ, saññæ,
sa³khæra and viññæ¼a) is self, atta. Even as he clings to the five
aggregates as atta these aggregates manifest their own oppressive
characters by inflicting pain of old age, pain of disease, pain of
defilements (kilesa). Because of these oppressive pains, the uninstructed
common worldling is subjected to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
despair. But when the worldling becomes instructed and has become
accomplished in the Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment, he does not
cling to the five aggregates through craving, conceit or holding wrong
views of self. Then even though the five aggregates manifest their own
characteristics of being oppressive, he is no longer subjected to mental
afflictions of sorrow, lamentations, pain, grief and despair.

108

In the Bhæra Sutta, the five groups of grasping
(Pañcupædænakkhandha) are designated as a burden, a heavy load. It is
craving for sense objects, craving for existence, craving for non-existence
which is responsible for this heavy burden being borne along. Realization
of the Noble Truth of Cessation, Nibbæna, is where the craving is
completely eradicated, where this heavy load is finally discarded.
The Yamaka Sutta explains that the five aggregates are of an
impermanent nature; they should be looked upon as one's enemies.
Understanding their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness,
insubstantiality, the twenty kinds of wrong views of self should be
discarded so that one may not be set upon by these enemies.
The Vakkali Sutta gives an account of the Buddha's visit to the ailing
Bhikkhu Vakkali upon his request. The great compassion of the Buddha
becomes manifest in this account. When Vakkali informs the Buddha that
for a long time he has been longing to set his eyes upon the Buddha, the
Buddha gently reproaches him: "Vakkali, what is there in seeing the
decomposing body of mine? It is enough to see the Dhamma. He who has
seen the Dhamma has seen me. This body of mine is like all else — always
rotting away, falling into decay." Then the Buddha teaches him the
dhamma on the impermanence of all things, their unsatisfactoriness and
insubstantiality and finally shows him the way to liberation.
Of the five aggregates, the Buddha says it is better for a person to
mistake his physical body as atta, self, rather than mind or consciousness,
because the physical body appears more solid and substantial than
thought or mind which constantly changes faster than the physical body.
The Khemaka Sutta records an illuminating conversation between a
bhikkhu named Khemaka and a group of bhikkhus who want to verify the
stage of his attainments. When the bhikkhus ask him if he sees self or
anything pertaining to self in the five aggregates, Khemaka replies "No."
But when the bhikkhus suggest that, if so, he must be an Arahat free from
defilements, Khemaka replies that though he does not find self or
anything pertaining to self in the five khandhas, he is not an Arahat free
of taints. He still has a vague feeling "I am" although he does not clearly
see "This is I" with respect to matter, sensation, perception, mental
formations or consciousness.
His vague feeling is likened to the smell of a flower: It is neither
the smell of the petals, nor of the colour, nor of the pollen, but the smell
of the flower. He then goes on to explain that even if a person retains the
feeling "I am" at the early stages of realization, as he progresses further
and attains to higher stages, this feeling of "I am" disappears altogether,

109

just as the smell of soap lingers in a freshly washed cloth and disappears
after a time when it is kept in a box.
In the Puppha Sutta, the Buddha declares that he is not quarrelling
or arguing with the world; it is only the world with its devas, mæras,
kings and people that is disputing with him. To proclaim the truth is not
engaging in disputes. He speaks only what wise men hold to be true.
Wise men say that there is no corporeality, sensation, perception, mental
formations or consciousness which is stable, permanent, enduring. He
says the same. Wise men say that there is only corporeality, sensation,
perception, mental formations or consciousness which is unstable,
impermanent, unenduring. He also says so.
"In this changing world, there are only things which are subject to
constant change and decay. Perceiving their real nature, I declare that the
world is compounded of things subject to decay and decomposition,
namely, the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, mental
formations and consciousness, which are incessantly rising and passing
away. There is nothing else besides these perishing aggregates. Bhikkhus,
I teach this dhamma in a brief manner. I also teach this dhamma more
comprehensively and completely. But if the uninstructed common
worldling remains unperceiving and unknowing in spite of very
enlightening discourses, how can I help? Bhikkhus, various kinds of lotus
grow in water, develop in water, rise above water, and remain there
unpolluted by water; so also I was born in this world, I grew up in this
world. I developed in this world and rose high above it without being
attached to it, without being affected by it".
In the Phe¼api¼ðþpama Sutta, the aggregate of rþpa is likened to
froth; it is unstable, impermanent, constantly rising, and vanishing. It is
therefore not self. The aggregate of vedanæ is likened to an air bubble.
The various sensations are just like bubbles, disappearing fast,
impermanent, untrustworthy, of the nature of anicca, dukkha and anatta.
Sense perception which apprehends whatever is seen, heard, smelt,
tested, touched or known, is likened to a mirage. What is considered by a
sama¼a as a being, a man, a woman or self is an optical illusion like a
mirage. In reality, it is merely a phenomenon of incessant arising and
vanishing. Sa³khæræ, volitional activities, are likened to plantain trunks.
A plantain trunk is made up of layers of fibrous material with no
substantial, solid inner core. Sa³khæra is like the plantain trunk void of
inner substance. Consciousness is like a conjuror's trick. It arises and
vanishes instantly. Consciousness arises not as one wishes, but as
conditioned by its own cause and circumstance.

110

(d) Sa¹æyatana Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
This division is made up of ten saµyuttas or groups. It deals mainly
with the six sense organs or bases of contact named internal sense bases
(eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind), six corresponding sense objects,
known as external sense bases (visible form, sound, odour, taste, tangible
things and mind-objects), and consciousness that arises in relation to each
pair of these internal and external sense bases. There are expositions on
the impermanent nature of these sense bases and how relinquishing of
attachment to them results in liberation. The sensation arising from
coming together of the sense bases and consciousness is shown to be of
three kinds: pleasant, unpleasant, indifferent, none of which is
permanent; each one of these is the cause of craving which in turn is the
root of all suffering. Concise but illuminating expositions on Nibbæna are
found in many suttas. So also are there practical guides for Vipassanæ
meditation.
In the very first two suttas, the Buddha explains that the six internal
sense bases and six external sense bases have the nature of
impermanence; being impermanent, they are really suffering and not self.
"Bhikkhus, realizing their true nature, you should not regard these twelve
sense bases as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is my self '. Contemplate
on them steadfastly, constantly, until Vipassanæ Insight into their real
nature arises." The Buddha continues to explain that insight into the true
nature of the twelve Æyatanas will develop dispassion and
disenchantment for them. Being disenchanted with them, there is no
craving, clinging, thereby achieving the Path and Fruition.
In the famous Æditta Sutta, the fire sermon, delivered at Gayæsisa to
one thousand ascetics formerly devoted to fire-worship but recently converted and admitted into the Order as bhikkhus, the Buddha explains that
each of the six sense bases and the six sense objects is burning; each is
burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of ignorance. Each is burning with the fire of birth, ageing and death; with the
fire of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Six forms of consciousness arising in relation to the six sense bases are also burning; the six
contacts and the six sensations resulting from them are also burning.
The Buddha explains further that when a bhikkhu who has practised
the dhamma develops Vipassanæ Insight and perceives that each of the
bases is burning, he becomes disenchanted with it. Then craving fades
away. With the fading of craving, he is liberated. And when liberated,
there is knowledge that he is liberated. At the end of the discourse, one
thousand former worshippers of fire attain Arahatship.

111

In the Pa¥hama Migajæla Sutta, the Buddha's definition of a
bhikkhu who lives in solitude is very edifying. When a bhikkhu
unmindfully takes delight in the six sense objects, regards them wrongly
as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is my self ', craving for them arises in
him and he becomes attached to fetters. Such a bhikkhu in whom craving
has arisen is regarded as one living with a companion, even if he lives
alone deep in a forest away from towns and villages. When, however, he
mindfully perceives the true nature of the six sense bases and objects, he
does not wrongly hold on to them as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is
my self ' and craving for them does not arise in him. Such a bhikkhu in
whom craving has not arisen is said to be living in solitude without any
companion even if he lives in the midst of people, in towns or villages.
The Pu¼¼a Sutta gives an account of a bhikkhu by the name of
Pu¼¼a who asks for instruction from the Buddha on a suitable subject on
which he can meditate in solitude. The Buddha advises him to
contemplate on the true nature of the six sense bases and objects. When
he perceives their true nature, no craving for them will arise in him.
Eradication of craving will result in liberation and attainment of
Arahatship. After receiving the instruction, the bhikkhu informs the
Buddha of his intention to reside in a very distant and remote land. The
Buddha tells him that it is a wild country inhabited by savage tribes, and
asks him how he intends to cope with the dangers and hazards that would
face him. The answer given by the bhikkhu provides a model lesson in
fortitude and endurance.
The bhikkhu says, if he were menaced with invectives and curses or
attacked physically, or if he had stones thrown at him or if he were hit
with sticks or cut with swords, or pierced with spears, he would bear
them with endurance with no malice against the savage tribes. Even if his
head were to be chopped off he would feel he was luckier than those
noble ones who had to commit suicide to be released from the sufferings
of the khandhas.
The Buddha remarks, "Well said, bhikkhu, well said. I believe you
are qualified to lead a solitary life in that wild country. You will
overcome all difficulties."
As presaged by the Buddha, the bhikkhu is able to overcome all
hostilities and difficulties in his new residence and to convert five hundred
men and five hundred women so that they come to take refuge in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha. And during the very first vassa
residence, practising the meditation as instructed by the Buddha, the
Bhikkhu Pu¼¼a attains Arahatship, fully accomplished in the three vijjæs.

112

In the Bhæradvæja Sutta, an interesting interview between King
Udena and the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja is described. King Udena
approaches the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja while he is meditating at
the foot of a tree in the king's park. The king remarks that many young
men have abandoned sensual pleasures and led the holy life. They
maintain the holy practice throughout their life. The king enquires, "What
is the means by which they maintain the purity of their holy life?" The
bhikkhu replies that they keep to the pure life by training themselves as
instructed by the Buddha to regard a woman of their mother's age as their
mother, a woman of their sister's age as their sister, and a girl of their
daughter's age as their daughter.
The king is not satisfied with the answer. He argues that even if a
bhikkhu trains himself in the said manner, it is no guarantee for the nonarising of impure thoughts in him in connection with a female person.
The Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja explains further they practise
meditation on the foulness of a body by contemplating on the thirty-two
constituent parts of the body. The king is still not convinced; he
maintains that, for older bhikkhus with more mature experience, who are
well established in mindfulness and concentration, contemplation on the
thirty-two constituent parts of the body might prove to be salutory; but
this type of meditation for younger bhikkhus might have an adverse
effect, exciting lust and passion instead of aversion for the human body.
Only when the Venerable Pi¼ðola Bhæradvæja tells him that the bhikkhus
practise restraint of the six faculties keeping a close watch on the doors of
the six senses that the king agrees that purity of the holy life is possible
under such circumstances.
In the Pa¥hama Dærukkhandhopama Sutta, the discourse given by
the Buddha on the bank of the River Ganges at Kosambø, the Buddha
uses the simile of a log floating down the river. He says that if the log
does not get stranded on either of the two banks, nor sinks in the middle
of the river, nor gets salvaged and deposited on the bank by some one,
nor is retrieved by men or devas, nor sucked in by a whirlpool, and if it
does not get decomposed on the way, it will be carried by the current till
its destination, the ocean, is reached.
In this simile, the near bank means the six internal sense bases; the
far bank represents the six external sense objects; sinking in the mid-river
means getting immersed in sensuous desires; being salvaged and
deposited on a bank means being hindered by one's own conceit; being
retrieved by men means doing some services or running errands for men;
being retrieved by devas means practising the holy life with the deva

113

realm as one's objective; being sucked in a whirlpool means wallowing
in sensual pleasures; getting decomposed on the way means becoming
corrupt, immoral, heedless of the disciplinary rules. If a bhikkhu manages
to steer himself clear of all these obstacles, he will be carried along by the
current of Right View till he reaches his destination, Nibbæna.
In the Chappæ¼akopama Sutta, the Buddha teaches that a bhikkhu
practising the holy life must exercise control of his sense faculties. The
six sense faculties may be likened to six animals, namely, a snake, a
crocodile, a giant bird, a dog, a jackal and a monkey. Suppose each
animal is bound by a rope and the ropes are tied together into a single
knot. When they are left in this state, each animal will try to get to its
own habitat, the snake to its underground hole, the crocodile to the river,
etc. In this way they will pull and struggle against one another until they
become exhausted and are dragged along by the strongest of them. The
mind of a bhikkhu with unrestrained sense faculties will be impelled by
the senses towards corresponding sense objects.
But suppose each animal is bound by a separate rope which is
fastened to a pole firmly planted in the ground. Each animal will make
furious attempts to return to its home and becoming exhausted finally
will stand, sit, curl or lie down quietly near the post. Similarly by
practising contemplation of the body, Kæyagatæsati, the sense faculties
are placed well under control. Mindfulness of the body serves as the firm
post to which each of the faculties is tied down.
Dukkarapañhæ Sutta states that in the Teaching of the Buddha, it is
difficult first to become a member of the Order as a novice and as a
bhikkhu. Secondly, it is difficult to be happy and comfortable in the
Order with its disciplinary rules. Thirdly, even if one stays the course and
remains in the Order, it is difficult for one to practise concentration
meditation and Vipassanæ meditation to attain to higher stages of
knowledge. When fully endowed with supporting pæramøs (perfections),
a bhikkhu who gets instruction in the morning and starts practising
meditation in the morning may be fully liberated by the evening; if he
gets instruction in the evening and starts practising meditation in the
evening he may be fully liberated by the morning.
A wealthy householder by the name of Citta figures quite
prominently in some of the suttas of this division. In Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta
Sutta, Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta finds himself unable to accept the view
expressed by the Buddha that there is jhæna and samædhi free from
vitakka and vicæra. He discusses this problem with Citta, the wealthy
householder, who is an Ariya disciple of the Buddha. Citta tells him: "I

114

believe there is jhæna and samædhi free from vitakka and vicæra, not
because of my faith in the Buddha but because of my own achievement
and realization." Citta explains that he has personally experienced jhæna
samædhi unaccompanied by vitakka and vicæra and has no need to rely on
others for believing this.
The same Citta used to have in his younger days a close friend who
later became the naked ascetic Kassapa. Each has gone his own separate
way and the two friends meet again only after thirty years. Citta asks his
friend whether by living the ascetic life he has gained any thing more
than what could be achieved by the wholesome dhamma of ordinary
people. The ascetic Kassapa admits that he has nothing to show besides
his nakedness, his shaven head and accumulation of dust on his body.
When asked in return what he himself has gained by being a
disciple of the Buddha and following the Path as instructed by his
Teacher, Citta informs him that he has become fully accomplished in the
four jhænas, and having removed the five fetters, is now an Anægæmø, a
Non-returner. The naked ascetic, impressed by his achievements, tells
Citta that he wants to be a disciple of the Buddha. Citta introduces him to
the leading bhikkhus and helps him to get admission into the Order. With
the guidance of the theras and encouragement of his friend Citta, the exascetic Kassapa puts in such an effort in the practice of meditation that in
no time he gains the supreme goal of Arahatship.
In the Sa³khadhama Sutta, the Buddha points out the wrong views
held by Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta on kamma and its resultant effects.
According to the village headman Asibandhakaputta, his Teacher
Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta teaches that every one who commits evil deeds of
killing, lying, etc. is definitely bound to be reborn in states of woe.
Whatever action is performed in a greater frequency, that action tends to
determine the destiny of a being. The Buddha points out the fallacy in the
two statements, one contradicting the other. An individual does not often
commit the evil deed, for instance, of killing. Other actions besides
killing are performed by him in a more frequent manner; hence,
according to Niga¼¥ha Næ¥aputta, he will not be destined to states of woe
for his evil act of killing.
Then the Buddha explains that only very heinous acts such as
killing of one's own parents, creating a schism in the Saµgha, etc. bring
the dire resultant effect of certain destiny in the states of woe. Other
misdeeds, physical, vocal or mental, cannot be regarded as to lead with
certainty to unhappy destinations. Instead of just feeling remorseful and
penitent over one's particular evil deed, one should recognize it to be

115

evil, and resolve not to repeat a similar unwholesome action, and follow
it with the practice of concentration and Vipassanæ meditation.
Thus abandoning all evil deeds and doing only wholesome deeds
together with development of Brahmavihæra Bhævanæ till accomplished
in jhæna, one can escape from the unhappy consequences of one's evil
actions and look forward to a better future. This Sa³khadhama Sutta
establishes the fact that as in matter of practice so also in the matters of
views, the Buddha takes the Middle Path.
In the Bhadraka Sutta, the Buddha explains the origin of suffering
by giving illuminating examples. The village headman Bhadraka wants to
know the cause of suffering that afflicts mankind. In reply, the Buddha
asks him to think of his son and imagine that his son is meeting with
unexpected misfortunes, or getting arrested by the king's order or facing
a severe punishment. Bhadraka imagines as he is told and finds that such
thoughts give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, grief and despair
in him. When he imagines a stranger to be placed in a similar situation,
facing similar predicament, he finds that he is not troubled at all with any
mental agony. He explains to the Buddha that the difference in his mental
reaction to the two situations lies in the fact that he loves his son with a
parent's love and is very fond of his son, whereas he has no such feeling
towards the stranger.
Next the Buddha asks him if any love, passion or desire arises in
him before he meets or sees or hears about the woman who has become
his wife. Bhadraka replies that only when he meets, sees and hears about
her that he develops passion and attachment towards his wife. When the
Buddha asks him further whether he will suffer from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, distress, grief, despair, if anything untoward happens
to his wife, he confesses that he will suffer more than these agonies; he
might even lose his life through intense suffering.
The Buddha points out then that the root cause of suffering in the
world is craving, greed, passion and desire that engulf mankind. It has
been so in the past, as it is now and so it will be in the future.

(e) Mahæ Vagga Saµyutta Pæ¹i
The last Vagga of Saµyutta Nikæya is made up of twelve
saµyuttas, the list of which gives a clear indication of the subjects dealt
with in this division: Magga Saµyutta, Bojjha³ga Saµyutta, Satipa¥¥hæna

116

Saµyutta, Indriya Saµyutta, Sammappadhæna Saµyutta, Bala Saµyutta,
Iddhipæda Saµyutta, Anuruddha Saµyutta, Jhæna Saµyutta, Ænæpæna
Saµyutta, Sotæpatti Saµyutta and Sacca Saµyutta. The main doctrines
which form the fundamental basis of the Buddha's Teaching are reviewed
in these saµyuttas, covering both the theoretical and practical aspects. In
the concluding suttas of the vagga, the ultimate goal of the holy life,
Arahatta Phala, Nibbæna, end of all suffering, is constantly kept in full
view together with a detailed description of the way of achieving it,
namely, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents.
In the opening suttas it is pointed out how friendship with the good
and association with the virtuous is of immense help for the attainment of
the Path and Perfection. It is one of the supporting factors conducive to
the welfare of a bhikkhu. Not having a virtuous friend and good adviser
is a great handicap for him in his endeavours to attain the Path.
In the Ku¼ðaliya Sutta, the wandering ascetic Ku¼ðaliya asks the
Buddha what his objective is in practising the holy life. When the Buddha
replies that he lives the holy life to enjoy the Fruits of the Path and the
bliss of liberation by knowledge, the ascetic wants to know how to achieve
these results. The Buddha advises him to cultivate and frequently practise
restraint of the five senses. This will establish the threefold good conduct
in deed, word and thought. When the threefold good conduct is cultivated
and frequently practised, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness will be
established. When the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are well
established the Seven Factors of Enlightenment will be developed. When
the Seven Factors of Enlightenment are developed and frequently applied,
the Fruits of the Path and liberation by knowledge will be achieved.
In the Udæyi Sutta, there is an account of Udæyi who gives
confirmation of such achievements through personal experience. He tells
how he comes to know about the five khandhas from the discourses, how
he practises contemplation on the arising and ceasing of these khandhas,
thereby developing Udayabbaya Ñæ¼a which, through frequent
cultivation, matures into Magga Insight. Progressing still further by
developing and applying frequently the Seven Factors of Enlightenment
he ultimately attains Arahatship. In many suttas are recorded the personal
experiences of bhikkhus and lay disciples who on being afflicted with
serious illness are advised to cultivate and practise the Seven Factors of
Enlightenment. They recount how they are relieved, not only of pains of
sickness but also of suffering that arises from craving.
In Saku¼agghi Sutta, the bhikkhus are exhorted by the Buddha to
keep within the confines of their own ground, i.e., the Four Foundations

117

of Mindfulness, namely, contemplation of body, sensation, mind and
mind-objects. They can roam freely in the safe resort guarded by these
outposts of Four Foundations of Mindfulness, unharmed by lust, hate and
ignorance. Once they stray outside their own ground, they expose
themselves to the allurements of the sensuous world. The parable of
falcon and skylark illustrates this point. A fierce falcon suddenly seizes
hold of a tiny skylark which is feeding in an open field. Clutched in the
claws of its captor, the unfortunate young bird bemoans its foolishness in
venturing outside of its own ground to fall a victim to the raiding falcon.
"If only I had stayed put on my own ground inherited from my parents, I
could easily have beaten off this attack by the falcon." Bemused by this
challenging soliloquy, the falcon asks the skylark where that ground
would be that it has inherited from its parents. The skylark replies, "The
interspaces between clods of earth in the ploughed fields are my ground
inherited from my parents." "All right, tiny tot, I shall release you now.
See if you can escape my clutches even on your own ground."
Then standing on a spot where three big clods of earth meet, the
skylark derisively invites the falcon, "Come and get me, you big brute."
Burning with fury, the falcon sweeps down with fierce speed to grab the
mocking little bird in its claws. The skylark quickly disappears into the
interspaces of the earth clods, but the big falcon, unable to arrest its own
speed, smashes into the hard protruding clods to meet its painful death.
In Bhikkhunupassaya Sutta, the Buddha explains for Ænanda's
benefit two methods of meditation. When established in the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness, a bhikkhu will experience a beneficial
result, gradually increasing. But should his mind be distracted by external
things during the contemplation on body, sensation, mind or mind-object,
the bhikkhu should direct his mind to some confidence-inspiring object,
such as recollection of the virtues of the Buddha. By doing so, he
experiences joy, rapture, tranquillity and happiness, which is conducive
to concentration. He can then revert back to the original object of
meditation. When his mind is not distracted by external things, no need
arises for him to direct his mind to any confidence-inspiring object. The
Buddha concludes his exhortation thus: "Here are trees and secluded
places, Ænanda. Practise meditation, Ænanda. Be not neglectful lest you
regret it afterwards."
As set out in the Cira¥¥hiti Sutta, the Venerable Ænanda takes this
injunction to heart and regards the practice of the Four Methods of
Steadfast Mindfulness as of supreme importance. When a bhikkhu by the
name of Badda asks the Venerable Ænanda, after the death of the

118

Buddha, what will bring about the disappearance of the Buddha's
Teaching, the Venerable Ænanda replies, "So long as the practice of the
Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness is not neglected, so long will the
Teaching prosper; but when the practice of the Four Methods of Steadfast
Mindfulness declines, the Teaching will gradually disappear."
Ænæpænassati meditation, one of the methods of body contemplation, consists in watching closely one's in-breath and out-breath and is
rated highly as being very beneficial. In the Mahæ Kappina Sutta, the
bhikkhus inform the Buddha, "We notice, Venerable Sir, that bhikkhu
Mahæ Kappina is always calm and collected, never excited, whether he is
in company or alone in the forest!" "It is so, bhikkhus. One who practises
Ænæpænassati meditation with mindfulness and full comprehension
remains calm in body and collected in mind, unruffled, unexcited."
The Icchæna³gala Sutta describes how the Buddha himself once
stayed for the rains-residence of three months in Icchæna³gala forest
grove in solitude practising Ænæpænassati meditation most of the time.
Ænæpænassati meditation is known as the abode of the Enlightened Ones,
the abode of the Noble Ones.
When fully accomplished in the cultivation of the Seven Factors of
Enlightenment, through practice of body contemplation or Ænæpænassati
meditation, one becomes firmly established in unshakable confidence in
the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha. The moral conduct of such a
person, through observance of precepts, is also without blemish. He has
reached, in his spiritual development, the stage of the Stream-winner,
Sotæpatti Magga, by virtue of which, he will never be reborn in states of
woe and misery. His path only leads upwards, towards the three higher
stages of accomplishment. He has only to plod on steadfastly without
looking backwards.
This is explained in the Pa¥hama Mahænæma Sutta, by the simile of
an earthern pot filled partly with gravel and stones and partly with fat and
butter. By throwing this pot into water and smashing it with a stick, it
will be seen that gravel and stones quickly sink to the bottom while fat
and butter rise to the surface of the water. Likewise, when a person who
has established himself in the five wholesome dhammas of faith, conduct,
learning, charity and insight dies, his body remains to get decomposed
but his extremely purified mental continuum continues in higher states of
existence as birth-linking consciousness, patisandhi citta.
In the concluding suttas are expositions on the Middle Path, the
Four Noble Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents.

119

The Buddha's first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,
appears in the last saµyutta, namely, Saccasaµyutta.
The Buddha did not make his claim to supremely perfect
enlightenment until he had acquired full understanding of the Four Noble
Truths. "As long, O bhikkhus, as my knowledge of reality and insight
regarding the Four Noble Truths in three aspects and twelve ways was
not fully clear to me, so long did I not admit to the world with its devas,
mæras and brahmæs, to the mass of beings with its recluses, brahmins,
kings and people that I had understood, attained and realized rightly by
myself the incomparable, the most excellent perfect enlightenment."
The Buddha concluded his first sermon with the words "This is my
last existence. Now there is no more rebirth for me."

120

Chapter VII
A³guttara Nikæya
This Collection of Discourses, A³guttara Nikæya, containing 9557
short suttas is divided into eleven divisions known as nipætas. Each
nipæta is divided again into groups called vaggas which usually contain
ten suttas. The discourses are arranged in progressive numerical order,
each nipæta containing suttas with items of dhamma, beginning with one
item and moving up by units of one till there are eleven items of dhamma
in each sutta of the last nipæta, Hence the name A³guttara meaning
'increasing by one item'. The first nipæta, Ekaka Nipæta, provides in each
sutta single items of dhamma called the Ones; the second nipæta, Duka
Nipæta, contains in each sutta two items of dhamma called the Twos, and
the last nipæta, Ekædasaka Nipæta, is made up of suttas with eleven items
of dhamma in each, called the Elevens.
A³guttara Nikæya constitutes an important source book on Buddhist
psychology and ethics, which provides an enumerated summary of all the
essential features concerning the theory and practice of the Dhamma. A
unique chapter entitled Etadagga Vagga of Ekaka Nipæta enumerates the
names of the foremost disciples amongst the bhikkhus, bhikkhunøs,
upæsakas, upæsikæs, who had achieved pre-eminence in one sphere of
attainment or meritorious activity, e.g. the Venerable Særiputta in
Intuitive Wisdom and Knowledge (Paññæ); the Venerable Mahæ
Moggallæna in supernormal powers (Iddhi); Bhikkhunø Khema in Paññæ;
Bhikkhunø Uppalava¼¼a in Iddhi; the Upæsaka Anæthapi¼ðika and the
Upæsikæ Visækhæ in alms-giving (Dæna); and so on.

(1) Ekaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
This group contains single items of dhamma which form the subject
matter of discourses given by the Buddha at Sævatthi to the numerous
bhikkhus residing there. But some of the suttas were given by the
Venerable Særiputta or the Venerable Ænanda.
(a) There is no one sight, sound, smell, taste and touch other than that of
a woman which can captivate and distract the mind of a man; conversely
there is no one sight, sound, smell, taste and touch other than that of a man
which can captivate and distract the mind of a woman. (paras 1 to 10)

121

(b) There is no other single thing that brings about so much disadvantage
and unhappiness as an undeveloped and uncultivated mind. A developed
and cultivated mind brings about benefit and happiness. (paras 28 to 31)
(c) No other single thing changes so quickly as the mind. The mind is
intrinsically pure and bright; it is defiled by greed, hatred and ignorance.
(paras 48, 49)
(d) If a bhikkhu practises the meditation of loving-kindness, and develops
it even for the short duration of a fingersnap, he is regarded as following
the advice of the Buddha, acting according to his instructions. Such a
bhikkhu deserves to eat the alms-food offered by the people. (paras 53, 54)
(e) There is only one person whose appearance in the world brings
welfare and happiness to the many, brings benefit, welfare and happiness
to devas and men. It is a Tathægata, a fully Enlightened Buddha.
It is impossible for two Enlightened Buddhas to appear
simultaneously in the same world system. (paras 170 to 174)
(f) It is impossible for a person possessed of right views, i.e. a Sotæpanna,
to regard any conditioned formation as permanent, happiness, Self (nicca,
sukha, atta). It is possible only for an uninstructed worldling to regard
anything as permanent, happiness, Self. (paras 268 to 270)
(g) If one thing is developed and frequently practised, the body is calmed,
the mind is calmed, discursive thinking is stilled, ignorance is shed,
knowledge arises, delusion of self is eliminated, evil tendencies are
eradicated, the fetters are removed. That one thing is the mindful
contemplation of the body. (paras 571 to 576)

(2) Duka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are two things to be borne in mind: not to be content with what
has been achieved in the process of development, i.e. even with the
attainment of jhænas or inner lights (which indicates a certain stage of
Insight meditation), and to resolve to struggle unremittingly and
strenuously until realization of the goal, the enlightenment. (para 5)
(b) There are two potentialities of men, to do good or to do evil. It is
possible to abandon evil; abandoning of evil brings benefit, and
happiness. It is also possible to cultivate the good. Cultivation of the
good brings benefit and happiness too. (para 19)

122

(c) Two things are conducive to attainment of liberation in two ways:
Concentration Meditation and Insight Meditation. If concentration is
developed, the mind becomes developed and passion fades away
resulting in liberation of mind. If insight is developed, wisdom is
developed and ignorance fades away resulting in liberation by
knowledge. (para 32)
(d) There are two persons one can never repay: mother and father. Even
if one should live a hundred years during which one attends upon one's
mother and father, heaps all one's attention, love and personal service on
them, one can never repay them for having, brought up, fed and guided
one through this life.
But if a person causes his parents who are non-believers to become
established in the faith and to take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Saµgha; if he causes his parents who do not observe the precepts
to become established in morality; if he causes his miserly parents to
become generous so that they come to share their wealth with the poor
and the needy; if he causes his ignorant parents to become established in
the knowledge of the Four Truths, then such a person repays and more
than repays his parents for what they have done for him. (paras 33, 34)
(e) There are two kinds of happiness. The happiness of the home life and
the happiness of homelessness; the happiness of homelessness is superior.
The happiness of the senses and the happiness of renunciation; the
happiness of renunciation is superior.
Tainted happiness and untainted happiness; ....... Carnal and noncarnal happiness; ....... and ignoble and noble happiness; ....... Bodily and
mental happiness; mental happiness is superior. (paras 65 to 71)

(3) Tika Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) The fool can be known by three things, by his conduct in deed, word
and thought; so also the wise man can be known by three things, by his
conduct in deed, word and thought. (para 3)
(b) There are three places a sovereign king should not forget: his birth
place, the place where he was crowned as king and the site of battle in
which he conquered his enemies. There are three places a bhikkhu should
not forget: the place of renunciation, the place where he achieved the
knowledge of the Four Noble Truths and the place where he attained
Arahatship. (para 12)

123

(c) He who devotes himself earnestly to his business in the morning, in
the daytime and in the evening, will prosper, and grow in wealth; the
bhikkhu who devotes himself earnestly to development of concentration
in the morning, in the daytime and in the evening will progress and gain
advancement in his spiritual work. (para 19)
(d) These three types of persons are found in the world: One with a mind
like an open sore; one with a mind like a flash of lightning; one with a
mind like a diamond.
One who is irascible and very irritable, displaying anger, hatred and
sulkiness; such a one is said to be a person with a mind like an open sore.
One who understands the Four Noble Truths correctly is said to
have a mind like a flash of lightning. One who has destroyed the mindintoxicating defilements and realized the liberation of mind and the
liberation by knowledge is said to have a mind like a diamond. (para 25)
(e) There are these three kinds of individuals in the world: One who
speaks words reeking with foul smell; one who speaks words of
fragrance; and one who speaks words sweet as honey. (para 28)
(f) There are three root causes for the origination of actions (kamma):
greed, hatred and ignorance. An action done in greed, hatred and
ignorance will ripen wherever the individual is reborn; and wherever the
action ripens, there the individual reaps the fruit (vipæka) of that action,
be it in this life, in the next life or in future existences. (para 38)
(g) He who prevents another from giving alms hinders and obstructs three
persons. He causes obstruction to the meritorious act of the donor; he
obstructs the recipient in getting his gift; he undermines and harms his
own character. (para 58)
(h) Three dangers from which a mother cannot shield her son nor the son
his mother: Old age, disease and death. (para 63)
(i) The well-known sutta, Kesamutti Sutta also known as Kælæma Sutta,
appears as the fifth sutta in the Mahævagga of the Tika Nipæta. At
Kesamutta, a small town in the Kingdom of Kosala, the Buddha thus
exhorted the Kælæmas, the inhabitants of the town: "Do not be led by
reports or traditions, or hearsay. Do not be led by the authority of
religious texts, nor by mere logic or inference, nor by considering
appearances, nor by speculative opinion, nor by seeming possibilities, nor
because one's own teacher has said so. O Kælæmas, when you know for
yourselves that certain things are wrong, unwholesome, bad, then give

124

them up; when you know for yourselves that certain things are right,
wholesome, good, then accept them, follow them." (para 66)
(j) A bhikkhu devoted to the holy life should pay equal attention to three
factors in turn, namely, concentration, energetic effort and equanimity,
and not exclusively to one of these factors only. If he gives regular
attention to each of them, his mind will become soft, pliant, malleable,
lucid and well concentrated, ready to be directed to whatever mental
states are realizable by supernormal knowledge. (para 103)
(k) There are three rare persons in the world: a Tathægata who is a
perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world; a person who can expound
the Teaching and Discipline as taught by the Buddha is rare in this world;
and a person who is grateful and thankful is rare in the world. (para 115)
(1) Whether a Tathægata appears in the world or not, the fact remains as a
firm and inevitable condition of existence that all conditioned formations
are impermanent, that all conditioned formations are subject to suffering,
that all things are devoid of self. (para 137)

(4) Catukka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) These four persons are found in the world: he who goes with the
stream; he who goes against the stream; he who stands firm; he who has
crossed over to the other shore and stands on dry land.
The person who indulges in sense desires and commits wrong deeds
is one who goes with the stream. He who does not indulge in sense
desires or commit wrong deeds, but lives the pure, chaste life, struggling
painfully and with difficulty to do so is one who goes against the stream.
He who stands firm is the person who, having destroyed the five lower
fetters, is reborn spontaneously in Brahma realm, whence he realizes
Nibbæna without ever returning to the sensuous sphere. The one who has
gone to the other shore standing on dry land is the person who has destroyed all the mental intoxicants, and who has realized, in this very life, by
himself, the liberation of the mind and liberation by knowledge. (para 5)
(b) There are four right efforts: (i) The energetic effort to prevent evil,
unwholesome states of mind from arising; (ii) the energetic effort to get
rid of evil, unwholesome states of mind that heave already arisen; (iii) the
energetic effort to arouse good, wholesome states of mind that have not

125

yet arisen; (iv) the energetic effort to develop and bring to perfection the
good and wholesome states of mind already arisen. (para 13)
(c) As a Tathægata speaks, so he acts; as he acts, so he speaks. Therefore
he is called a Tathægata. (para 23)
(d) There are four highest kinds of faith: The Tathægata, the holiest and
fully enlightened, is the highest among all living beings. Among all
conditioned things, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents is the highest.
Among all conditioned and unconditioned things, Nibbæna is the highest.
Amongst all groups of men, the Order of the Tathægata, the Saµgha
made up of the four pairs of noble men, the eight Ariyas, is the highest.
For those who have faith in the highest, namely, the Buddha, the
Path, the Nibbæna and the Ariyas the highest resultant effects (result of
action) will be theirs. (para 34)
(e) There are four ways of dealing with questions: (i) Some should be
given direct answers, (ii) others should be answered by way of analysing
them, (iii) some questions should be answered by counter-questions, (iv)
lastly, some questions should simply be put aside. (para 42)
(f) There are four distortions (vipallæsas) in perception, thought and view.
To hold that there is permanence in the impermanence; to hold that there
is happiness in suffering; to hold that there is atta where there is no atta;
to hold that there is pleasantness (subha) in that which is foul. (para 49)
(g) When Nakulapitæ and Nakulamætæ express their wish to the Buddha
to be in one another's sight as long as the present life lasts and in the
future life as well, the Buddha advises them to try to have the same faith,
the same virtue, the same generosity and the same wisdom; then they will
have their wish fulfilled. (paras 55-56)
(h) He who gives food gives four things to those who receive it. He gives
them long life, beauty, happiness and strength. The donor himself will be
endowed with long life, beauty, happiness and strength wherever he is
born in the human or the deva world. (para 57)
(i) There are four subjects not fit for speculative thought (Acinteyyæni).
They are: the specific qualities of a Buddha (Buddhavisayo); a person's
jhæna attainment; the results of Kamma; and the nature of the world (loka
cintæ). These imponderables are not to be pondered upon; which, if
pondered upon, would lead one to mental distress and insanity. (para 77)
(j) There are four things concerning which no one whether sama¼a,
bræhma¼a, deva, Mæra or anyone else in the world can give a guarantee:

126

(i) That what is liable to decay should not decay;
(ii) that what is liable to illness should not fall ill;
(iii) that what is liable to die should not die; and
(iv) that no resultant effects should come forth
from those evil deeds done previously. (para 182)
(k) There are four ways by which a person's character may be judged:
His virtue can be known by a wise and intelligent person paying
close attention after living together with him for a very long time. His
integrity can be known by a wise and intelligent person by having
dealings with him, paying close attention over a long period of time. His
fortitude can be known by a wise and intelligent person by observing him
with close attention in times of misfortune. His wisdom can be judged by
a wise and intelligent person when conversing with him on various
subjects over a long period of time. (para 192)
(l) There are four things conducive to the growth of wisdom: associating
with a good person; hearing the good Dhamma; maintaining a right attitude of mind and leading a life in accordance with the Dhamma. (para 248)

(5) Pañcaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are five strengths possessed by a person in training for higher
knowledge: faith, shame (to do evil), moral dread, energy and insightknowledge. He believes in the enlightenment of the Buddha; he feels
ashamed of wrong conduct in deed, word and thought; he dreads
anything evil and unwholesome; he arouses energy to abandon
everything unwholesome and to acquire everything that is wholesome; he
perceives the phenomenon of constant rising and ceasing and is thus
equipped with insight which will finally lead him to Nibbæna, destruction
of suffering. (para 2)
(b) There are also other five strengths, namely, faith, energy,
mindfulness, concentration and insight-knowledge. The strength of faith
is seen in the four characteristic qualities of a Stream-winner; the strength
of energy is seen in the four Right Efforts; the strength of mindfulness is
seen in the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness and the strength of
concentration is seen in the four jhænas; the strength of insight-knowledge

127

is seen in the perception of the phenomenon of constant rising and
ceasing, an insight which will finally lend to Nibbæna. (para 14)
(c) Impurities that defile gold are iron, tin, lead, silver, and other metals.
Impurities that defile mind are sensuous desire, ill will, sloth and torpor,
restlessness and worry, sceptical doubts. (para 23)
(d) A giver of alms surpasses a non-giver in five aspects, namely, in lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame and power, whether both be reborn in the
deva world or the human world. This difference in five aspects will
persist till liberation is achieved. There is then no distinction between the
liberation of one and the other or between one arahat and the other. (para 31)
(e) There are five contemplations which ought to be practised by
everyone, bhikkhus or layfolks, men and women:
'I am certain to become old. I cannot avoid ageing.
'I am certain to become ill and diseased. I cannot avoid illness.
'I am certain to die. I cannot avoid death.
'All things dear and beloved will not last. They will be subject to
change and separation.
'My kamma (past and present actions) is my only property, kamma is
my only heritage, kamma is the only cause of my being, kamma is
my only kin, my only protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad,
I shall become their heir.' (para 57)
(f) Five standards which should be set up for teaching the Dhamma: the
Dhamma should be taught in graduated discourses; the Dhamma should
be given as a well-reasoned discourse; the Dhamma should be given out
of compassion and sympathy; the Dhamma should not be given for the
sake of worldly gain and advantage; the Dhamma should be taught
without alluding to oneself or others. (para 159)
(g) There are five ways of getting rid of a grudge: If a grudge arises
towards any person, then one should cultivate loving-kindness, or compassion or equanimity towards him. Or one should pay no attention to him
and give no thought to him. Or one may apply the thought: his only property is his actions; whatever he does, good or bad, he will be heir to that.
In these ways, all grudges that have arisen can be removed. (para 161)
(h) Wrong occupations which should not be followed by a lay disciple:
Trading in arms and weapons; trading in living beings; trading in meat;
trading in intoxicants; trading in poison. (para 177)

128

(6) Chakka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are six things which are unsurpassed: The noblest things seen,
the noblest things heard, the noblest gain, the noblest learning, the
noblest service, and the noblest reflection. The sight of the Tathægata or
the Tathægata's disciples is the noblest thing seen. The hearing of the
Dhamma from the Tathægata or his disciples is the noblest thing heard.
Faith in the Tathægata or his disciples is the noblest gain. Learning
supreme virtue (adhisøla), supreme mind development (adhicitta),
supreme wisdom (adhipaññæ) is the noblest learning. Serving the
Tathægata or his disciples is the noblest service. Reflecting on the virtues
of the Tathægata or his disciples is the noblest reflection. (para 30)
(b) There are six kinds of suffering in the world for one who indulges in
sense-pleasures: poverty, indebtedness, owing interest, being demanded
repaying, being pressed and harassed by creditors, imprisonment.
Similarly in the Teaching of the Ariyas, a person is regarded to be
poor and destitute who lacks faith in things that are meritorious, who has no
shame and no scruples, no energy and no understanding of things that are
good, and who conducts himself badly in deed, word and thoughts. (para 45)
(c) There are six steps to gain liberation: Sense-control provides the basis
for morality. Morality gives the foundation to Right Concentration. Right
Concentration provides the basis for understanding of the true nature of
physical and mental phenomena. With understanding of the true nature of
physical and mental phenomena comes disenchantment and nonattachment. Where there is disenchantment and non-attachment, there
arises the knowledge and vision of liberation. (para 50)
(d) There are six things to be known: Sense-desires, feelings, perceptions,
moral intoxicants (æsavas), kamma and dukkha should be known, their
causal origin should be known, their diversity, their resulting effects,
their cessation and the way leading to their cessation should be known.
The way leading to the cessation of all these dhammas is the Noble
Path of Eight Constituents. (para 63)
(e) There are six things which appear very rarely in the world: Rare is the
appearance in the world of a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha; rare is the
appearance of one who teaches the Dhamma and Vinaya as proclaimed
by the Buddha; rare it is to be reborn in the land of the Ariyas; rare it is to
be in possession of unimpaired physical and mental faculties; rare it is to
be free from dumbness and stupidity; rare it is to be endowed with the
desire for doing good, wholesome things. (para 96)

129

(f) There are six benefits in realizing the Sotæpatti Fruition: (i) firm faith
in the Dhamma ; (ii) impossibility of falling back; (iii) limit to suffering
in the round of existences (only seven more existences); (iv) being
endowed with supramundane knowledge which is not shared by the
common worldling; (v) and (vi) clear understanding of causes and
phenomena arising therefrom. (para 97)

(7) Sattaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are seven factors for winning respect and esteem of fellow
bhikkhus: having no desire for gain; not wanting to be shown reverence
but indifferent to attention; being ashamed of doing evil; being fearful of
doing evil; and having little want; and having the right view. (para 1)
(b) A bhikkhu becomes an eminent field for sowing seeds of merit, when
he knows the text of the Teaching, knows the meaning of the Teaching,
also knows himself, knows the proper limit for acceptance of offerings,
knows the proper time for various activities, knows his audience, and
knows the spiritual tendency of an individual. (para 68)
(c) If a bhikkhu develops his mind in the four methods of Steadfast
Mindfulness, the four Right Efforts, the four bases of Psychic Power, the
five Faculties, the five Strengths, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the
Noble Path of Eight Constituents, he will be freed of the mental
intoxicants, without any attachment, whether he wishes or not for
liberation. (para 71)
(d) Short is the life of man, just like the dew-drop on the tip of a blade of
grass; a bubble appearing on the water when rain falls; a line drawn on
water with a stick; a mountain stream; a lump of spittle on the tip of the
tongue; a piece of meat thrown into an extremely hot iron pot; and a cow
being led to be slaughtered, whenever she lifts a leg, she will be closer to
slaughter, closer to death. (para 74)
(e) Those teachings that lead to disenchantment, entire turning away from
worldliness, non-attachment, cessation and calm, direct knowledge,
enlightenment and Nibbæna — such teachings may be taken as the true
Dhamma and Discipline, as the Buddha's Teaching. (para 83)

130

(8) A¥¥haka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are eight benefits accruing from practice of meditation on
loving-kindness: Whosoever practises meditation on loving-kindness
enjoys sound sleep, wakes up fresh and well, is not disturbed by bad
dreams, is regarded with esteem by men, is treated with respect by nonhumans, is accorded protection by devas, is not hurt by fire, poison or
weapons and is destined to reappear in the Brahma realm. (para 1)
(b) There are eight worldly conditions, the vicissitudes of life that keep
the world turning round: gain, loss, fame, disrepute, praise, blame,
happiness, suffering. (para 546)
(c) There are eight strengths: The strength of child lies in crying; of a
woman in her anger; of a bandit in his arms; of a king in his sovereignty;
of an unwise man in censure and reviling; of a wise man in careful
consideration of pros and cons; of a man of knowledge in caution; and
the strength of a bhikkhu lies in his fortitude and forbearance. (para 27)
(d) Eight great reflections of the Venerable Anuruddha on the Dhamma:
This Dhamma is for one with few wants, not for one who wants much.
This Dhamma is for the contented, not for one hard to be satisfied. This
Dhamma is for one who loves solitude, not for one who loves company.
This Dhamma is for the energetic, not for the indolent. This Dhamma is
for one of vigilant mindfulness, not for the heedless. This Dhamma is for
one of concentrated mind, not for the distracted. This Dhamma is for the
wise, not for the unintelligent. This Dhamma is for one who delights in
Nibbæna, not for one who rejoices in worldliness (conceit, craving and
wrong view). (para 30)
(e) There are eight types of speech by an Ariya: Having not seen, he says
he has not seen; having not heard, he says he has not heard; having not
sensed, he says he has not sensed; having not known, he says he has not
known. Having seen, he says he has seen; having heard, says he has
heard; having sensed, he says he has sensed and having known, he says
he has known. (para 68)

(9) Navaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) Nine practices not indulged in by Arahats: An Arahat does not
intentionally take the life of a being; does not take, with the intention of
stealing, what is not given; does not engage in sexual intercourse; does
not speak what is not true knowing that it is not true; does not enjoy the

131

pleasures of the senses; is not biased through favouritism, through hatred,
through delusion or through fear. (para 7)
(b) There are nine characteristics of a layman's residence which a
bhikkhu should not visit or stay in: Where a bhikkhu is not greeted or
shown signs of welcome, or offered a seat; where alms are kept hidden;
where little is given away although much can be afforded; where inferior
alms are offered although better alms are available; where the offering is
made in a disrespectful manner; where the layman does not come near
the bhikkhu to listen to the dhamma, and where little interest is shown in
the exposition of the dhamma. (para 17)
(c) There are nine ways in which a grudge is formed: He has done me
harm, he is doing me harm, he will do me harm; he has done harm to one
dear to me, he is doing harm to one dear to me, he will do harm to one
dear to me; he has done good to one disliked by me; he is doing good to
one disliked by me, he will do good to one disliked by me. (para 29)
(d) There are nine things which should be eliminated in order to achieve
realization of Arahatta Phala: Lust, ill will, ignorance, anger, grudge,
ingratitude, envy, jealousy, meanness. (para 62)

(10) Dasaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are ten benefits of being established in søla, morality: One who
is established in søla feels pleased; feeling pleased he feels glad; feeling
glad, he is delightfully satisfied; being delightfully satisfied he becomes
calm; when he is calm, he feels happiness; when he feels happiness, his
mind becomes concentrated; with concentrated mind, he sees things as
they really are; seeing things as they really are, he becomes disenchanted
and dispassionate towards them; when there is no more passion or
attachment, he achieves liberation of mind and liberation by knowledge.
(para 1)
(b) There are ten fetters: Personality belief (Sakkæyadi¥¥hi), sceptical
doubts, mistaking mere rites and ceremony as the true Path, sense-desire,
ill will, attachment to Rþpa realm, attachment to Arþpa realm, conceit,
restlessness, ignorance. (para 12)
(c) Just as a young man or a woman looks into the mirror to find out if
there are any blemishes on the face, so also it is necessary for a bhikkhu
to engage in occasional self-examination to see whether covetousness, ill
will, sloth and torpor have arisen in him or not, whether worry and

132

excitement, and doubts exist in him, whether he is free from anger and
his mind is defiled or not by unwholesome thoughts; whether his body is
at ease without restlessness; whether he is beset by laziness or not; and
whether he has concentration of mind with clear comprehension. (para 51)
(d) There are ten dhammas possessed by one who has become
accomplished, an Arahat: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech,
Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right
Concentration, Right Knowledge, Right Liberation. (para 112)

(11) Ekædasaka Nipæta Pæ¹i
(a) There are eleven kinds of destruction any one of which is likely to
befall a bhikkhu who reviles the fellow bhikkhus of the community: Lack
of progress in his efforts; declining from the stage already achieved;
tainted and defiled understanding of the Dhamma; being overcome by his
own conceit; unhappiness in leading the holy life; liability to commit
offences against the disciplinary rules; likelihood of reverting to the
household life; likelihood of being afflicted with an incurable disease;
likelihood of becoming mentally deranged; dying with a confused mind
and likelihood of being reborn in the Nether Worlds. (para 6)
(b) There are eleven benefits derived from cultivation and development
of loving-kindness, when frequently practised and firmly established:
One sleeps soundly and wakes peacefully with no bad dreams; one is
regarded with esteem by men; is treated with respect by non-humans; is
protected by devas; is unharmed by fire, poison or weapons; his mind is
easily concentrated; the features of his face are serene; he will die with an
unconfused mind; if he does not attain to Arahatship, he will be reborn in
the Brahma realm. (para 15)

133

Chapter VIII
Khuddaka Nikæya
Of the five Nikæyas, Khuddaka Nikæya contains the largest number
of treatises (as listed below) and the most numerous categories of
dhamma. Although the word "Khuddaka" literally means "minor" or
"small", the actual content of this collection can by no means be regarded
as minor, including as it does the two major divisions of the Pi¥aka,
namely, the Vinaya Pi¥aka and the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka according to one
system of classification. The miscellaneous nature of this collection,
containing not only the discourses by the Buddha but compilations of
brief doctrinal notes mostly in verse, accounts of personal struggles and
achievements by theras and therøs also in verse, the birth stories, the
history of the Buddha etc., may account for its title.
The following is the list of treatises as approved by the Sixth
International Buddhist Synod.

(1) Khuddakapæ¥ha Pæ¹i
First of the treatises in this Nikæya, Khuddakapæ¥ha, contains
"readings of mirror passages" most of which are also found in other parts
of Tipi¥aka. It is a collection of nine short formulae and suttas used as a
manual for novices under training, namely, (a) the three refuges (b) the
Ten Precepts (c) the thirty-two parts of the body (d) simple Dhammas for
novices in the form of a catechism (e) Ma³gala Sutta (f) Ratana Sutta
(g) Tiroku¥¥a Sutta (h) Niðhika¼ða Sutta and (i) Metta Sutta.
Taking refuge in the Three Gems, the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
Saµgha, by reciting the formula, "I take refuge in the Buddha, I take
refuge in the Dhamma, I take refuge in the Saµgha," is a conscious act of
expression of complete faith in the Three Gems, not mere profession of
superficial belief nor a rite of traditional piety. It implies (i) one's
humility; (ii) acceptance of the Triple Gems as one's guiding principles
and ideals; (iii) acceptance of discipleship and (iv) homage.
In the section on 'Kumæra pañha,' questions for young boys, the
dhamma is tailored to suit the young intellect of novices:
What is the One?

The Nutriment which sustains the life
of beings.
What are the Two?
— Næma and Rþpa.
What are the Three?
— Pleasant, Unpleasant, Neutral Vedanæs.
What are the Four?
— The Four Noble Truths.
What are the Five?
— The five groups of grasping.
What are the Six?
— The six bases of senses.
What are the Seven?
— The seven factors of enlightenment.
What are the Eight?
— The Noble Path of Eight Constituents.
What are the Nine?
— The nine abodes or types of beings.
What are the Ten?
— The ten demeritorious courses of
action.
Mahæ Ma³gala Sutta, the discourse on the great blessings, is a
famous sutta cherished highly in all Buddhist countries. It is a
comprehensive summary of Buddhist ethics for the individual as well as
for society, composed in elegant verses. The thirty-eight blessings
enumerated in the sutta as unfailing guides throughout one's life start
with advice on 'avoidance of bad company' and provide ideals and
practices basic to all moral and spiritual progress, for the welfare and
happiness of the individual, the family and the community. The final
—

135

blessing is on the development of the mind which is unruffled by
vagaries of fortune, affected by sorrow, cleansed of defilements and
which thus gains liberation — the mind of an Arahat.
The Ratana Sutta was delivered by the Buddha when Vesælø was
plagued by famine, disease etc. He had been requested by the Licchavø
Princes to come from Ræjagatha to Vesælø. The sutta was delivered for the
purpose of countering the plagues, by invocation of the truth of the special
qualities of the Three Gems, the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saµgha.
The Metta Sutta was taught to a group of bhikkhus who were troubled by non-human beings while sitting in meditation at the foot of secluded
forest trees. The Buddha showed them how to develop loving-kindness
towards all beings, the practice which will not only protect them from
harm but also will serve as a basis for insight through attainment of jhæna.
The Khuddakapæ¥ha which is a collection of these nine formulae
and suttas appears to be arranged in such a way as to form a continuous
theme demonstrating the practice of the holy life: how a person accepts
the Buddha's Teaching by taking refuge in the Three Gems; then how he
observes the Ten Precepts for moral purification. Next he takes up a
meditation subject, the contemplation of thirty-two constituents of the
body, to develop non-attachment. He is shown next the virtues and merits
of giving and how one handicaps oneself by not performing acts of merit.
In the meanwhile he safeguards himself by reciting the Ma³gala Sutta
and provides protection to others by reciting the Ratana Sutta. Finally, he
develops loving-kindness towards all beings, thereby keeping himself
safe from harm, at the same time he achieves jhænic concentration which
will eventually lead him to reach the goal of spiritual life, Nibbæna, by
means of knowledge of Insight and the Path.
(2) The Dhammapada Pæ¹i
It is a book of the Tipi¥aka which is popular and well-known not
only in Buddhist countries but also elsewhere. The 'Dhammapada' is a
collection of the Buddha's words or basic and essential principles of the
Buddha's Teaching. It consists of 423 verses arranged according to topics
in twenty-six vaggas or chapters.
Verse 183 gives the teachings of the Buddha in a nutshell: Abstain
from all evil; Promote (develop) what is good and purify your mind. Each
stanza is packed with the essence of Truth which illumines the path of a
wayfarer. Many are the Dhammapada verses which find their way into
the writings and everyday speech of the Buddhists. One can get much

136

sustenance and encouragement from the Dhammapada not only for
spiritual development but also for everyday living.
The Dhammapada describes the path which a wayfarer should
follow. It states (in verses 277, 278 and 279) that all conditioned things
are transitory and impermanent; that all conditioned things are subject to
suffering; and that all things (dhammas) are insubstantial, incapable of
being called one's own. When one sees the real nature of things with
(Vipassanæ) insight, one becomes disillusioned with the charms and
attractions of the Five Aggregates. Such disillusionment constitutes the
path of purity (Nibbæna).
Verse 243 defines the highest form of impurity as ignorance (avijjæ)
and states that the suffering in the world can be brought to an end only by
the destruction of craving or hankering after sensual pleasures. Greed, ill
will and ignorance are described as dangerous as fire and unless they are
held under restraint, a happy life is impossible both now and thereafter.
Avoiding the two extremes, namely, indulgence in a life of
sensuous pleasures and the practice of self-mortification, one must follow
the Middle Path, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents to attain perfect
Peace, Nibbæna. Attainment to the lowest stage (Sotæpatti Magga) on this
Path shown by the Buddha is to be preferred even to the possession of the
whole world (V. 178). The Dhammapada emphasizes that one makes or
mars oneself, and no one else can help one to rid oneself of impurity.
Even the Buddhas cannot render help; they can only show the way and
guide; a man must strive for himself.
The Dhammapada recommends a life of peace and non-violence
and points out the eternal law that hatred does not cease by hatred,
enmity is never overcome by enmity but only by kindness and love (V.5).
It advises to conquer anger by loving-kindness, evil by good, miserliness
by generosity, and falsehood by truth.
The Dhammapada contains gems of literary excellence, replete with
appropriate similes and universal truths and is thus found appealing and
edifying by readers all the world over. It serves as a digest of the essential
principles and features of the Buddha Dhamma as well as of the wisdom
of all the ages.
(3) Udæna Pæ¹i
An udæna is an utterance mostly in metrical form inspired by a
particularly intense emotion. This treatise is a collection of eighty joyful

137

utterances made by the Buddha on unique occasions of sheer bliss; each
udæna in verse is accompanied by an account in prose of the
circumstances that led to their being uttered.
For example, in the first Bodhivagga Sutta are recorded the first
words spoken aloud by the newly Enlightened Buddha in three stanzas
beginning with the famous opening lines: "Yadæ have pætubhavanti
dhammæ, Ætæpino jhæyato bræhma¼assa."
For seven days after his Enlightenment, the Buddha sat at the foot
of the Bodhi tree feeling the bliss of liberation. At the end of seven days,
he emerged from this (Phala Samæpatti) sustained absorption in FruitionMind, to deliberate upon the principle of Dependent Origination: When
this is, that is (Imasmiµ sati, idaµ hoti); this having arisen, that arises
(Imassuppædæ, idaµ uppajjati); when this is not, that is not (Imasmiµ
asati, idaµ na hoti); this having ceased, that ceases (Imassa nirodhæ, idaµ
nirujjhati).
In the first watch of the night, when the principle of the origin of
the whole mass of suffering was thoroughly grasped in a detailed manner
in the order of arising, the Buddha uttered the first stanza of joy:
"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardently
meditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he understands
what that nature is as well as its cause."
In the second watch of the night, his mind was occupied with the
principle of Dependent Origination in the order of ceasing. When the
manner of cessation of suffering was thoroughly understood, the Buddha
was moved again to utter the second stanza of jubilation:
"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardently
meditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he perceives the
cessation of causes."
In the third watch of the night, the Buddha went over the detailed
formula of the principle of Dependent Origination, Pa¥icca Samuppæda,
in both the orders of arising and ceasing. Then having mastered the
doctrine of Dependent Origination very thoroughly, the Buddha uttered
the third stanza of solemn utterance:
"When the real nature of things becomes clear to the ardently
meditating recluse, then like the sun that illumines the sky, he stands
repelling the dark hosts of Mæra."

138

(4) Itivuttaka Pæ¹i
The fourth treatise contains 112 suttas divided into four nipætas
with verses and prose mixed, one supplementing the other. Although the
collection contains the inspired sayings of the Buddha as in Udæna, each
passage is preceded by the phrase 'Iti vuttaµ Bhagavatæ', 'thus was said
by the Buddha,' and reads like a personal note book in which are
recorded short pithy sayings of the Buddha.
The division into nipætas instead of vaggas denotes that the
collection is classified in ascending numerical order of the categories of
the dhamma as in the nipætas of the A³guttara. Thus in Lkaka Nipæta are
passages dealing with single items of the dhamma: "Bhikkhus, abandon
craving; I guarantee attainment to the stage of an Anægæmø if you
abandon craving." In Duka Nipæta, each passage deals with units of two
items of the dhamma: There are two forms of Nibbæna dhætu, namely,
Sa-upædisesa Nibbæna dhætu, with the five khandhas still remaining, and
Anupædisesa Nibbæna dhætu, without any khandha remaining.
(5) Suttanipæta Pæ¹i
As well-known as Dhammapada, Sutta Nipæta is also a work in
verse with occasional introductions in prose. It is divided into five
vaggas: (i) Uraga Vagga of 12 suttas; (ii) Cþ¹a Vagga of 14 suttas;
(iii) Mahæ Vagga of 12 suttas; (iv) A¥¥haka Vagga of 16 suttas and
(v) Pæræyana Vagga of 16 questions.
In the twelve suttas of the Uraga Vagga are found some important
teachings of the Buddha which may be practised in the course of one's
daily life:
"True friends are rare to come by these days; a show of
friendship very often hides some private ends. Man's mind is
defiled by self-interest. So, becoming disillusioned, roam alone
like a rhinoceros."
(Khaggavisæ¼a Sutta)
"Not by birth does one become an outcast, not by birth does
one become a bræhma¼a;
By one's action one becomes an outcast, by one's action one
becomes a bræhma¼a."
(Vasala Sutta)
"As a mother even with her life protects her only child, so let
one cultivate immeasurable loving-kindness towards all living beings."
(Mettæ Sutta)

139

Pæræyana Vagga deals with sixteen questions asked by sixteen
brahmin youths while the Buddha is staying at Pæsænaka Shrine in the
country of Magadha. The Buddha gives his answers to each of the
questions asked by the youths. Knowing the meaning of each question
and of the answers given by the Buddha, if one practises the Dhamma as
instructed in this sutta, one can surely reach the Other Shore, which is
free from ageing and death. The Dhamma in this sutta is known as
Pæræyana because it leads to the Other Shore, Nibbæna.
(6) Vimæna Vatthu Pæ¹i
Vimæna means mansion. Here it refers to celestial mansions gained
by beings who have done acts of merit. In this text are eighty-five verses
grouped in seven vaggas; in the first four vaggas, celestial females give
an account of what acts of merit they have done in previous existences as
human beings and how they are reborn in deva realm where magnificent
mansions await their appearance. In the last three vaggas, the celestial
males tell their stories.
The Venerable Mahæ Moggalæna who can visit the deva realm
brings back these stories as told him by the deva concerned and recounts
them to the Buddha who confirms the stories by supplying more
background details to them. These discourses are given with a view to
bring out the fact that the human world offers plenty of opportunities for
performing meritorious acts. The other objective for such discourses is to
refute the wrong views of those who believe that nothing exists after this
life (the annihilationists) and those who maintain that there is no resultant
effect to any action.
Of the eighty-five stories described, five stories concern those who
have been reborn in deva world having developed themselves to the stage
of Sotæpanna in their previous existences; two stories on those who have
made obeisance to the Buddha with clasped hands; one on those who had
expressed words of jubilation at the ceremony of building a monastery
for the Saµgha; two stories on those who had observed the moral
precepts; two stories on those who had observed the precepts and given
alms; and the rest deal with those who have been reborn in the deva
world as the wholesome result of giving alms only.
The vivid accounts of the lives of the devas in various deva abodes
serve to show clearly that the higher beings are not immortals, nor creators,
but are also evolved, conditioned by the results of their previous meritorious

140

deeds; that they too are subject to the laws of anicca, dukkha and anatta
and have to strive themselves to achieve the deathless state of Nibbæna.
(7) Peta Vatthu Pæ¹i
"The stories of petas" are graphic accounts of the miserable states
of beings who have been reborn in unhappy existences as a consequence
of their evil deeds. There are fifty-one stories, divided into four vaggas,
describing the life of misery of the evil doers, in direct contrast to the
magnificent life of the devas.
Emphasis is again laid on the beneficial effects of giving; whereas
envy, jealousy, miserliness, greed and wrong views are shown to be the
causes for appearance in the unhappy state of petas. The chief suffering
in this state is dire lack of food, clothing and dwelling for the condemned
being. A certain and immediate release from such miseries can be given
to the unfortunate being if his former relatives perform meritorious deeds
and share the merit with him. In Tiroku¥¥apeta Vatthu, a detailed account
is given on how King Bimbisæra brings relief to his former relatives who
are unfortunately suffering as petas, by making generous offer of food,
clothing and dwelling places to the Buddha and his company of bhikkhus
and sharing the merit, thus accrued, to the petas who have been his kith
and kin in previous lives.
(8) The Thera Gæthæ Pæ¹i
and
(9) The Therø Gæthæ Pæ¹i
These two treatises form a compilation of delightful verses uttered
by some two hundred and sixty-four theras and seventy-three therøs
through sheer exultation and joy that arise out of their religious devotion
and inspiration These inspiring verses gush forth from the hearts of
bhikkhus and bhikkhunøs after their attainment of Arahatship as an
announcement of their achievement and also as statement of their effort
which has led to their final enlightenment.
It may be learnt from these jubilant verses how a trifling incident in
life, a trivial circumstance can become the starting point of spiritual effort
which culminates in supreme liberation. But for some of the theras, the
call has come early to them to forsake the homelife and take to the life of
a homeless recluse. Their struggle has been hard because of the inner
fight between the forces of good and evil. They have had a good fight and

141

they have won by dint of resolution and ardent determination. The
crippling bonds of greed, hatred and ignorance have been broken asunder
and they are freed. In sheer exultation, they utter forth these inspiring
verses, proclaiming their freedom and victory. Some of these theras
reach the sublime height of poetic beauty when they recount their solitary
life in the quiet glades and groves of forest, the beauteous nature that
forms their surroundings, and the peace and calm that have facilitated
their meditation.
Although the verses in the Therø Gæthæ lack the poetic excellence
and impassioned expression of love of solitude that characterise the
verses in the Thera Gæthæ, they nevertheless reflect the great piety and
unflinching resolution with which the therøs have struggled to reach the
goal. One distinguishing feature of the struggle of the therøs is that many
of them receive the final impetus to seek solace in holy life through
emotional imbalance they have been subject to, for example, loss of the
dear ones as in the case of Pa¥æcærø, or through intense personal suffering
over the death of a beloved son as suffered by Kisæ Gotamø.
Both the Thera Gæthæ and the Therø Gæthæ provide us with shining,
inspiring models of excellence, so consoling and so uplifting, so human
and true to life, leading us on to the path of the holy life, stimulating us
when our spirit drops, our mind flags, and guiding us through internal
conflicts and set-backs.
These gæthæs may be enjoyed simply as beautiful poems with
exquisite imagery and pleasing words or they may be contemplated on as
inspiring messages with deep meaning to uplift the mind to the highest
levels of spiritual attainment.
"Rain god! My abode has a roofing now for my comfortable living;
it will shield me from the onset of wind and storm. Rain god! Pour down
to thy heart's content; my mind is calm and unshakeable, free from
fetters. I dwell striving strenuously with untiring zeal. Rain god! Pour
down to thy heart's content." (Verse 325)
The bhikkhu has now his 'abode' of the five khandhas well
protected by 'the roofing and walls' of sense restraints and paññæ. He
lives thus comfortably, well shielded from the rain and storm of lust,
craving and attachments. Undisturbed by the pouring rain, and whirling
wind of conceit, ignorance, hatred, he remains calm and composed,
unpolluted. Although he lives thus in security and comfort of liberation
and calm, he keeps alert and mindful, ever ready to cope with any
emergency that may arise through lack of mindfulness.

142

(10) Jætaka Pæ¹i
Birth-stories of the Buddha
These are stories of the previous existences of Gotama Buddha,
while he was as yet but a Bodhisatta. The Jætaka is an extensive work in
verses containing five hundred and forty-seven stories or previous
existences as recounted by the Buddha, (usually referred to in Burma as
550 stories). The treatise is divided into nipætas according to the number
of verses concerning each story; the one verse stories are classified as
Ekaka Nipæta, the two verse stories come under Duka Nipæta etc. It is the
commentary to the verses which gives the complete birth-stories.
In these birth-stories are embedded moral principles and practices
which the Bodhisatta had observed for self-development and perfection
to attain Buddhahood.
(11) Niddesa Pæ¹i
This division of Khuddaka Nikæya consists of two parts: Mahæ
Niddesa, the major exposition which is the commentary on the fourth
vagga (A¥¥haka) of the Sutta Nipæta and Cþ¹a Niddesa, the minor
exposition which is the commentary on the fifth vagga (Pæræyana) and on
the Khaggavisæ¼a Sutta in the first vagga. Attributed to the Venerable
Særiputta, these exegetical works contain much material on the
Abhidhamma and constitute the earliest forms of commentaries,
providing evidence of commentarial tradition many centuries before the
Venerable Buddhaghosa appeared on the scene.
(12) Pa¥isaµbhidæ Magga Pæ¹i
This treatise, entitled the Path of Analysis, is attributed to the
Venerable Særiputta. Dealing with salient teachings of the Buddha
analytically in the style of the Abhidhamma, it is divided into three main
vaggas, namely, Mahæ Vagga, Yuganaddha Vagga and Paññæ Vagga.
Each Vagga consists of ten sub-groups, named kathæs, such as Ñæ¼a
Kathæ, Di¥¥hi Kathæ etc.
The treatment of each subject matter is very detailed and provides
theoretical foundation for the practice of the Path.

143

(13) Apadæna Pæ¹i
It is a biographical work containing the life stories (past and
present) of the Buddha and his Arahat disciples. It is divided into two
divisions: the Theræpadæna giving the life stories of the Buddha, of fortyone Paccekabuddhas and of five hundred and fifty-nine Arahats from the
Venerable Særiputta to the Venerable Ra¥¥hapæla; and Therøpadæna with
the life stories of forty therø Arahats from Sumedhæ Therø to Pesalæ Therø.
Apadæna here means a biography or a life story of a particularly
accomplished person, who has made a firm resolution to strive for the
goal he desires, and who has ultimately achieved his goal, namely,
Buddhahood for an Enlightened One, Arahatship for his disciples.
Whereas the Thera Gæthæ and the Therø Gæthæ depict generally the
triumphant moment of achievements of the theras and therøs, the
Apadæna describes the up-hill work they have to undertake to reach the
summit of their ambition. The Gæthæs and the Apadænas supplement one
another to unfold the inspiring tales of hard struggles and final conquests.
(14) Buddhavaµsa Pæ¹i
History of the Buddhas
Buddhavaµsa Pæ¹i gives a short historical account of Gotama
Buddha and of the twenty-four previous Buddhas who had prophesied his
attainment of Buddhahood. It consists of twenty-nine sections in verse.
The first section gives an account of how the Venerable Særiputta
asks the Buddha when it was that he first resolved to work for attainment
of the Buddhahood and what pæramøs (virtues towards perfection) he had
fulfilled to achieve his goal of Perfect Enlightenment. In the second
section, the Buddha describes how as Sumedha the hermit, being inspired
by Døpa³kara Buddha, he makes the resolution for the attainment of
Buddhahood and how the Buddha Døpa³kara gives the hermit Sumedha
his blessing prophesying that Sumedha would become a Buddha by the
name of Gotama after a lapse of four asa³kheyya and a hundred thousand
kappas (world cycles).
From then onwards, the Bodhisatta Sumedha keeps on practising
the ten pæramøs, namely, alms-giving, morality renunciation, wisdom,
perseverance, forbearance, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness
and equanimity. The Buddha relates how he fulfils these pæramøs, exist-ence
after existence, and how each of the twenty-four Buddhas, who appeared
after Døpa³kara Buddha at different intervals of world cycles, renewed the
prophesy that he would become a Buddha by the name of Gotama.

144

In sections three to twenty-seven are accounts of the twenty-five
Buddhas including Gotama Buddha, giving details about each of them
with regard to birth, status, names of their parents, names of their wives
and children, their life-span, their way of renunciation, duration of their
efforts to attain Buddhahood, their teaching of the Dhammacakka Sutta in
the Migadæyavana, the names of their Chief Disciples and their chief lay
disciples. Each section is closed with an account of where the Buddhas
pass away and how their relics are distributed.
In the twenty-eighth section is given the names of three Buddhas,
namely, Ta¼ha³kara, Medha³kara and Sara¼a³kara who lived before
Døpa³kara Buddha at different intervals of the same world cycle. The
names of other Buddhas (up to Gotama Buddha) are also enumerated
together with the name of the kappas in which they have appeared.
Finally there is the prophesy by the Buddha that Metteyya Buddha would
arise after him in this world.
The last section gives an account of how the Buddha's relics are
distributed and where they are preserved.
(15) Cariyæ Pi¥aka
This treatise contains thirty-five stories of the Buddha's previous
lives retold at the request of the Venerable Særiputta. Whereas the Jætaka
is concerned with the Buddha's previous existences from the time of
Sumedha, the hermit, till he becomes Gotama Buddha, Cariyæ Pi¥aka
deals only with thirty-five of the existences of the Bodhisatta in this last
world cycle. The Venerable Særiputta's object in making the request is to
bring out into bold relief the indomitable will, the supreme effort, the
peerless sacrifice with which the Bodhisatta conducts himself in
fulfilment of the ten pæramøs (virtues towards Perfection).
The Bodhisatta has, throughout innumerable ages, fulfilled the ten
pæramøs for countless number of times. Cariyæ Pi¥aka records such
performances in thirty-five existences, selecting seven out of the ten
pæramøs, and recounts how each pæramø is accomplished in each of these
existences. Ten stories in the first vagga are concerned with accumulation
of virtues in alms-giving, the second vagga has ten stories on the practice
of morality and the last vagga mentions fifteen stories, five of them
dealing with renunciation, one with firm determination, six with
truthfulness, two with loving-kindness and one with equanimity.

145

(16) Netti and (17) Pe¥akopadesa
The two small works, Netti, made up of seven chapters, and
Pe¥akopadesa, made up of eight chapters, are different from the other books
of the Tipi¥aka because they are exegetical and methodological in nature.
(18) Milindapañha Pæ¹i
Milindapañha Pæ¹i is the last of the books which constitute
Khuddaka Nikæya. It records the questions asked by King Milinda and
the answers given by the Venerable Nægasena some five hundred years
after the Parinibbæna of the Buddha. King Milinda was Yonaka (GraecoBactrian) ruler of Sægala. He was very learned and highly skilled in the
art of debating. The Venerable Nægasena, a fully accomplished Arahat,
was on a visit to Sægala at the request of the Saµgha.
King Milinda, who wanted to have some points on the Dhamma
clarified, asked the Venerable Nægasena abstruse questions concerning
the nature of man, his survival after death, and other doctrinal aspects of
the Dhamma. The Venerable Nægasena gave him satisfactory replies on
each question asked. These erudite questions and answers on the
Teaching of the Buddha are compiled into the book known as the
Milindapañha Pæ¹i.

146

Chapter IX
WHAT IS ABHIDHAMMA PI¿AKA?
(a) Abhidhamma, the Higher Teaching of the Buddha.
Abhidhamma is the third great division of the Pi¥aka. It is a huge
collection of systematically arranged, tabulated and classified doctrines
of the Buddha, representing the quintessence of his Teaching.
Abhidhamma means Higher Teaching or Special Teaching; it is unique in
its abstruseness, analytical approach, immensity of scope and
conduciveness to one's liberation.
The Buddha dhamma has only one taste, the taste of liberation. But
in Suttanta discourses, the Buddha takes into consideration the
intellectual level of his audience, and their attainments in pæramø. He
therefore teaches the dhamma in conventional terms (vohæra vacana),
making references to persons and objects as I, we, he, she, man, woman,
cow, tree, etc. But in Abhidhamma the Buddha makes no such
concessions; he treats the dhamma entirely in terms of the ultimate reality
(Paramattha sacca). He analyses every phenomenon into its ultimate
constituents. All relative concepts such as man, mountain, etc. are
reduced to their ultimate elements which are then precisely defined,
classified and systematically arranged.
Thus in Abhidhamma everything is expressed in terms of khandhas,
five aggregates of existence; æyatanas, five sensory organs and mind, and
their respective sense objects; dhætu, elements; indriya, faculties; sacca,
fundamental truths; and so on. Relative conceptual objects such as man,
woman, etc. are resolved into ultimate components of khandhas,
æyatanas, etc. and viewed as an impersonal psycho-physical
phenomenon, which is conditioned by various factors and is impermanent
(anicca), suffering (dukkha) and is without a permanent entity (anatta).
Having resolved all phenomena into ultimate components
analytically (as in Dhammasa³ga¼ø and Vibha³ga) it aims at synthesis by
defining inter-relations (paccaya) between the various constituent factors
(as in Pa¥¥hæna). Thus Abhidhamma forms a gigantic edifice of
knowledge relating to the ultimate realities which, in its immensity of
scope, grandeur, subtlety, and profundity, properly belongs only to the
intellectual domain of the Buddha.

147

(b) The seven books of Abhidhamma.
The Suttanta Pi¥aka also contains discourses dealings with
analytical discussions and conditional relationship of the five aggregates.
Where the need arises subjects such as the five aggregates, æyatanas, etc.
are mentioned in the sutta discourses. But they are explained only briefly
by what is known as the Sutta Method of Analysis (Suttanta bhæjanøya),
giving bare definitions with limited descriptions. For example, khandhas,
the five aggregates, are enumerated as the corporeal aggregate, the
aggregate of sensation, the aggregate of perception; the aggregate of
mental formations (volitional activities) and the aggregate of
consciousness. They may be dealt with a little more comprehensively; for
instance, the corporeal aggregate may be further defined as corporeality
of the past, the present or the future; the corporeality which is internal or
external, coarse or fine, inferior or superior, far or near. The Sutta
Method of Analysis does not usually go further than this definition.
But the Abhidhamma approach is more thorough, more penetrating,
breaking down each corporeal or mental component into the ultimate, the
most infinitesimal unit. For example, Rþpakkhandha, corporeal
aggregate, has been analysed into twenty-eight constituents;
Vedanækkhandha, the aggregate of sensation, into five; Saññækkhandha,
the aggregate of perception, into six; Sankhærakkhandha, the aggregate of
mental formations, into fifty; and Viññænakkhandha, the aggregate of
consciousness, into eighty-nine. Then each constituent part is minutely
described with its properties and qualities and its place in the well
arranged system of classification is defined.
A complete description of things requires also a statement of how
each component part stands in relation to other component parts. This
entails therefore a synthetical approach as well, to study the interrelationship between constituent parts and how they are related to other
internal or external factors.
Thus the Abhidhamma approach covers a wide field of study,
consisting of analytical and synthetical methods of investigation,
describing and defining minutely the constituent parts of aggregates,
classifying them under well ordered heads and well arranged systems and
finally setting out conditions in which they are related to each other. Such
a large scope of intellectual endeavour needs to be encompassed in a
voluminous and classified compilation. Hence the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka is
made up of seven massive treatises, namely, (i) Dhammasa³ga¼ø,
containing detailed enumeration of all phenomena with an analysis of
consciousness (citta) and its concomitant mental factors (cetasikas);

148

(ii) Vibha³ga, consists of eighteen separate sections on analysis of
phenomena quite distinct from that of Dhammasa³ga¼ø; (iii) Dhætukathæ,
a small treatise written in the form of a catechism, discussing all
phenomena of existence with reference to three categories, khandha,
æyatana and dhætu; (iv) Puggalapaññatti, a small treatise giving a
description of various types of individuals according to the stage of their
achievement along the Path; (v) Kathævatthu, a compilation by the
Venerable Moggaliputta, the presiding thera of the third Great Synod in
which he discusses and refutes doctrines of other schools in order to
uproot all points of controversy on the Buddha dhamma; (vi) Yamaka,
regarded as a treatise on applied logic in which analytical procedure is
arranged in pairs; (vii) Pa¥¥hæna a gigantic treatise which together with
Dhammasa³ga¼ø, the first book, constitutes the quintessence of the
Abhidhamma Pi¥aka. It is a minutely detailed study of the doctrine of
conditionality, based on twenty-four paccayas, conditions or relations.

(c) Conventional Truth (Sammuti Sacca) and Ultimate Truth (Paramattha
Sacca).
Two kinds of Truth are recognised in the Abhidhamma according to
which only four categories of things namely, mind (consciousness),
mental concomitants, Materiality and Nibbæna are classed as the Ultimate
Truth; all the rest are regarded as apparent truth. When we use such
expressions as 'I', 'you', 'man', 'woman', 'person', 'individual', we are
speaking about things which do not exist in reality. By using such
expressions about things which exist only in designation, we are not
telling a lie; we are merely speaking an apparent truth, making use of
conventional language, without which no communication will be
possible.
But the Ultimate Truth is that there is no 'person', 'individual' or
'I' in reality. There exist only khandhas made up of corporeality, mind
(consciousness) and mental concomitants. These are real in that they are
not just designations, they actually exist in us or around us.

149

Chapter X
ABHIDHAMMA PI¿AKA
I. The Dhammasa³ga¼ø Pæ¹i
The Dhammasa³ga¼ø, the first book of the Abhidhamma, and the
Pa¥¥hæna, the last book, are the most important of the seven treatises of
Abhidhamma, providing as they do the quintessence of the entire
Abhidhamma.
Scheme of Classification in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø
(1) The Mætikæ
The Dhammasa³ga¼ø enumerates all the dhammas (phenomena)
i.e., all categories of næma, namely, Consciousness and mental
concomitant, and rþpa, Corporeality. Having enumerated the phenomena,
they are arranged under different heads to bring out their exact nature,
function and mutual relationship both internally (in our own being) and
with the outside world. The Dhammasa³ga¼ø begins with a complete list
of heads called the Mætikæ. The Mætikæ serves as a classified table of
mental constituents treated not only in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø but in the
entire system of the Abhidhamma.
The Mætikæ consists altogether of one hundred and twenty-two
groups, of which the first twenty-two are called the Tikas or Triads, those
that are divided under three heads; and the remaining one hundred are
called the Dukas or Dyads, those that are divided under two heads.
Examples of Triads are:
(a) Kusala Tika:
dhammas
(i) that are moral, kusala,
(ii) that are immoral, akusala,
(iii) that are indeterminate, abyækata.
(b) Vedanæ Tika:
dhammas that
(i) with pleasant feeling,
are associated
(ii) with painful feeling,
(iii) with neutral feeling.

150

Examples of Dyads are:
(a) Hetu Duka: dhammas

(i) that are roots, hetus
(ii) the are not roots, na-hetu.
(b) Sahetuka Duka: dhammas
(i) that are associated with the hetus
(ii) that are not associated with the
hetus.
The Mætikæ concludes with a list of the categories of dhamma
entitled Suttantika Mætikæ made up of forty-two groups of dhamma found
in the suttas.
(2) The four Divisions
Based on these Mætikæs of Tikas and Dukas, the Dhammasa³ga¼ø
is divided into four Divisions:
(i) Cittuppæda Ka¼ða Division on the arising of consciousness and
mental concomitants.
(ii) Rþpa Ka¼ða
Division concerning corporeality.
(iii) Nikkhepa Ka¼ða
Division that avoids elaboration.
(iv) A¥¥hakathæ Ka¼ða Division of Supplementary Digest.
Of the four divisions, the first two, namely, Cittuppæda Ka¼ða and
Rþpa Ka¼ða form the main and essential portion of the book. They set
the model of thorough investigation into the nature, properties, function
and interrelationship of each of the dhammas listed in the Mætikæ, by
providing a sample analysis and review of the first Tika, namely, the
Kusala Tika of Kusala, Akusala and Abyækata Dhamma. Cittuppæda
Ka¼ða deals with a complete enumeration of all the states of mind that
come under the headings of Kusala and Akusala; the Rþpa Ka¼ða is
concerned with all states of matter that come under the heading of
Abyækata; mention is also made of Asa³khata Dhætu (Nibbæna) without
discussing it.
The Nikkhepa Ka¼ða the third division, gives, not too elaborately
nor too briefly, the summary of distribution of all the Tikas and Dukas, so
that their full contents and significance will become comprehensible and
fully covered.

151

A¥¥hakathæ Ka¼ða, the last division of the book, is of the same
nature as the third division, giving a summary of the dhammas under the
different heads of the Tika and the Duka groups. But it provides it in a
more condensed manner, thus forming a supplementary digest of the first
book of the Abhidhamma for easy memorizing.
(3) Order and classification of the types of Consciousness as discussed in
Cittuppæda Ka¼ða.
The Cittuppæda Ka¼ða first gives a statement of the types of
Consciousness arranged under the three heads of the first Tika, namely,
(i) Kusala Dhamma i.e., Meritorious Consciousness and its concomitants
(ii) Akusala Dhamma i.e., Demeritorious Consciousness and its
concomitants (iii) Abyækata Dhamma i.e., Indeterminate Consciousness
and its concomitants. The list of mental concomitants for each dhamma is
fairly long and repetitive.
The statement of the types of Consciousness is followed by
identification of the particular type e.g. Kusala Dhamma, in the form of
question and answer, with regard to the plane or sphere (bhþmi) of
Consciousness: Kæmævacara, sensuous plane; Rþpævacara, plane of form;
Arþpævacara, plane of no-form; Tebhþmaka, pertaining to all the three
planes; or Lokuttara, supramundane, not pertaining to the three planes.
The type of Consciousness for each plane is further divided into
various kinds e.g., there are eight kinds of Kusala Dhamma for the
sensuous plane: first Kusala Citta, second Kusala Citta etc; twelve kinds
of Akusala Citta; eight kinds of Ahetuka Kusala Vipæka Citta and eight
kinds of Sahetuka Vipæka Citta under the heading of Abyækata Dhamma.
Then these various kinds are further analysed according to:
(i) Dhamma Vavatthæna Vara e.g., the particular quality, whether
accompanied by joy etc. i.e., somanassa, domanassa, sukha, dukkha, or
upekkhæ.
(ii) Ko¥¥hæsa Væra, the grouping of dhammas. There are twenty-three
categories of dhammas which result from synthetical grouping of
dhammas into separate categories such as khandhas, æyatanas, dhætus etc.
(iii) Suññata Væra, which lays stress on the fact that there is no
'self’' (atta) or jøva behind all these dhammas; they are only composites,
causally formed and conditioned, devoid of any abiding substance.
The same method of treatment is adopted for the akusala and
abyækata types of Consciousness.

152

(4) Rþpa Ka¼ða
Because Dhammasa³ga¼ø treats all the dhammas (næmas as well as
rþpas) in the same uniform system of classification, Rþpa Ka¼ða is only
a continuation of the distribution of the Dhamma under the heads of the
first Tika, which begins in the first division, Cittuppæda Ka¼ða. In the
Cittuppæda Ka¼ða, the enumeration of the Dhamma under the head
'Abyækata' has been only partially done, because abyækata type of
Dhamma includes not only all the states of mind which are neither
meritorious nor demeritorious but also all states of matter and the
Asa³khata Dhætu or Nibbæna. The portion of Dhamma under the heading
of Abyækata, which has been left out from Cittuppæda Ka¼ða, is attended
to in this ka¼ða.
The method of treatment here is similar, with the difference that
instead of mental concomitants, the constituents of matter, namely, the
four primary elements and the material qualities derived from them with
their properties and their relationships are analysed and classified.

II. Vibha³ga Pæ¹i
Book of Analysis
The second book of the Abhidhamma Pi¥aka, Vibha³ga, together
with the first book Dhammasa³ga¼ø and the third book Dhætukathæ,
forms a closely related foundation for the proper and deep understanding
of the Buddha's Dhamma. Whereas Dhammasa³ga¼ø provides a bird's
eye view of the whole of the Tika and Duka groups with further
systematic arrangements under classified heads, Vibha³ga and
Dhætukathæ give a closer view of selected portions of those groups
bringing out minute details.
Thus, Ko¥¥hæsa Væra in Dhammasa³ga¼ø explains what and how
many khandha, æyatana, dhætu, æhæra, indriya, jhæna³ga etc. are
included in the Tika and Duka groups. But it does not furnish complete
information about these dhammas. It is Vibha³ga which provides full
knowledge concerning them, stating the exact nature of each dhamma, its
constituents and its relationship to other dhammas.
The Vibha³ga is divided into eighteen Chapters each dealing with a
particular aspect of the Dhamma; its full analysis and investigation into
each constituent. The arrangement and classification into groups and

153

heads follow the same system as in the Dhammasa³ga¼ø. Vibha³ga may
therefore be regarded as complementary to Dhammasa³ga¼ø.
Vibha³ga explains comprehensively the following categories of
Dhamma.
(i) Khandha
(ii) Æyatana
(iii) Dhætu
(iv) Sacca
(v) Indriya
(vi) Paticcasamuppæda
(vii) Satipa¥¥hæna
(viii) Sammappadhæna
(ix) Iddhipæda

(x)
Bojjha³ga
(xi) Magga
(xii) Jhæna
(xiii) Appammaññæ
(xiv) Sikkhæpada
(xv) Pa¥isaµbhidæ
(xvi) Ñæ¼a
(xvii) Khuddhaka vatthu
(xviii) Dhammahadaya

Each category is analysed end discussed in two or all the three of
the following methods of analysis: Suttanta bhæjanøya — the meaning of
the terms and the classification of the dhammas determined according to
the Suttanta method; Abhidhamma bhæjanøya — the meaning of the terms
and the classification of the dhammas determined according to the
Abhidhamma method; Pañha pucchaka, discussions in the form of
questions and answers.
It may be seen from the above list of the eighteen categories that
they may be divided into three separate groups. The first group
containing numbers (i)-(vi) deals with mental and corporeal constituents
of beings and two laws of nature to which they are constantly subjected
viz: the Law of Impermanence and the Law of Dependent Origination.
The second group containing numbers (vii)-(xii) is concerned with the
practice of the holy life which will take beings out of suffering and
rounds of existence. The remaining six categories serve as a supplement
to the first two groups, supplying fuller information and details where
necessary.

154

III. Dhætukathæ Pæ¹i
Although this third book of Abhidhamma Pi¥aka is a small treatise,
it ranks with the first two books forming an important trilogy, which must
be thoroughly digested for the complete understanding of the
Abhidhamma. Vibha³ga, the second book, has one complete chapter
devoted to the analysis of dhætus, but the subject matter of dhætu is so
important that this separate treatise is devoted to it for a thorough
consideration. The method of analysis here is different from that
employed in the Vibha³ga.
Dhætukathæ studies how the dhammas listed in the Tikas and Dukas
of the Mætikæ are related to the three categories of khandha, æyatana and
dhætu in their complete distribution i.e., five khandhas, twelve æyatanas
and eighteen dhætus. These are discussed in fourteen ways of analytical
investigations which constitute the fourteen chapters of Dhætukathæ.

IV. Puggalapaññatti Pæ¹i
Abhidhamma is mainly concerned with the study of abstract truths
in absolute terms. But in describing the dhammas in their various aspects,
it is not possible to keep to absolute terms only. Inevitably, conventional
terms of every day language have to be employed in order to keep the
lines of communication open at all. Abhidhamma states that there are two
main types of conventional usage; the first type is concerned with terms
which express things that actually exist in reality and the second type
describes things which have no existence in reality.
The first three books of the Abhidhamma investigate the absolute
Truth of Dhamma in a planned system of detailed analysis employing
such terms as Khandha, Æyatana, Dhætu, Sacca and Indriya. These terms
are mere designations which express things that exist in reality and are
therefore classed as the conventional usage of the first type. To the
second type of conventional usage belong such expressions as man,
woman, deva, individual etc., which have no existence in reality, but
nevertheless are essential for communication of thoughts.
It becomes necessary therefore to distinguish between these two
types of apparent truths. But as the terms Khandha, Æyatana, Dhætu,
Sacca and Indriya have been elaborately dealt with in the first three
books, they are dealt with here only briefly. The terms used in the second

155

type concerning individuals are given more weight and space in the
treatise, hence its title Puggalapaññatti, designation of individuals.
Different types of individuals are classified, in ten chapters of the book,
after the manner of enumeration employed in A³guttara Nikæya.

V. Kathævatthu Pæ¹i
Kathævatthu, like Puggalapaññatti, falls outside the regular system
of the Abhidhamma. It does not directly deal with the abstruse nature of
the Dhamma. It is mainly concerned with wrong views such as "Person
exists; Self exists; Jøva exists" which were prevalent even in the
Buddha's time, or wrong views such as "Arahat falls away from
Arahatship" which arose after the Parinibbæna of the Buddha.
About two hundred and eighteen years after the Parinibbæna of the
Buddha there were altogether Eighteen Sects, all claiming to be followers
of the Buddha's Teaching. Of these only the Theravædins were truly
orthodox, while the rest were all schismatic. The Emperor Asoka set
about removing the impure elements from the Order with the guidance
and assistance of the Elder Moggaliputtatissa who was an accomplished
Arahat. Under his direction, the Order held in concord the Uposatha
ceremony which had not been held for seven years because of dissensions
and the presence of false bhikkhus in the Order.
At that assembly, the Venerable Moggaliputtatissa expounded on
points of views, made up of five hundred orthodox statements and five
hundred statements of other views, in order to refute the wrong views that
had crept into the Saµgha and that might in the future arise. He followed
the heads of discourses, Mætikæ, outlined by the Buddha himself and
analysed them in detail into one thousand statements of views. This
collection of statements of views was recited by one thousand selected
theras who formed the Third Great Synod, to be incorporated into the
Abhidhamma Pi¥aka.
The style of compilation of this treatise is quite different from that
of other treatises, written as it is in the form of dialogue between two
imaginary debators, one holding the heterodox views of different sects
and the other representing the orthodox views.

VI. Yamaka Pæ¹i
The Dhammasa³ga¼ø, the Vibha³ga and the Dhætukathæ examine
the Dhamma and their classifications as they exist in the world of reality,
named Sa³khæraloka. Puggalapaññatti and Kathævatthu deal with beings
and individuals which also exist in their own world of apparent reality,
known as Sattaloka. Where the dhamma of Sa³khæraloka and beings of
the Sattaloka co-exist is termed the Okæsaloka. Yamaka sets out to define
and analyse the interrelationship of dhammas and puggalas as they exist
in these three worlds.
This is accomplished in the form of pairs of questions, which gives
it the title of Yamaka. The logical process of conversion (anuloma) and
complete inversion (pa¥iloma) is applied to determine the complete
import and limit of a term in its relationship with the others. An
equivocal nature of a term (saµsaya) is avoided by showing, through
such arrangement of questions, how other meanings of the term do not fit
for a particular consideration.
The following pairs of questions may be taken as an example:
To the question 'May all rþpa be called Rþpakkhanda?' the answer
is 'Rþpa is also used in such expressions as piya rþpa (loveable nature),
eva rþpa (of such nature), but there it does not mean Rþpakkhandha.'
But to the question 'May all Rþpakkhandha be called rþpa?' the
answer is 'yes', because Rþpakkhandha is a very wide term and includes
such terms as piya rþpa, eva rþpa etc.

VII. Pa¥¥hæna Pæ¹i
Pa¥¥hæna Pæ¹i, the seventh and last book of the Abhidhamma, is
called the Mahæ Pakæra¼a, the 'Great Book' announcing the supreme
position it occupies and the height of excellence it has reached in its
investigations into the ultimate nature of all the dhammas in the
Universe.
The Dhammasa³ga¼ø gives an enumeration of these dhammas
classifying them under the Tika and Duka groups. Vibha³ga analyses
them to show what dhammas are contained in the major categories of
khandhas, æyatanas, dhætus etc. Dhætukathæ studies the relationship of
dhammas listed in the Mætikæ with each component of these major

157

categories of khandhas, æyatanas and dhætus. Yamaka resolves
ambiguity in the internal and external relationship of each dhamma.
Pa¥¥hæna forming the last book of the Abhidhamma brings together all
such relationship in a co-ordinated form to show that the dhammas do not
exist as isolated entities but they constitute a well ordered system in
which the smallest unit conditions the rest of it and is also being
conditioned in return. The arrangement of the system is so very intricate,
complex, highly thorough and complete that it earns for this treatise the
reputation of being deep, profound and unfathomable.
An outline of the Pa¥¥hæna system of relations.
Pa¥¥hæna, made up of the words "pa and ¥hæna", means a system of
relations. The Great Treatise of Pa¥¥hæna arranges all conditioned things,
(twenty-two Tikas and one hundred Dukas of the Mætikæ), under twentyfour kinds of relations, describes and classifies them into a complete
system for understanding the mechanics of the universe of Dhamma. The
whole work is divided into four great divisions, namely:
(i) Anuloma Pa¥¥hæna

which studies the instances in which
paccaya relations do exist between
the dhammas.

(ii) Paccanøya Pa¥¥hæna

which studies the instances in which
paccaya relations do not exist
between the dhammas.

(iii) Anuloma Paccanøya

Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances
in which some of the paccaya
relations do exist between the
dhamma s but the others do not.

(iv) Paccanøya Anuloma

Pa¥¥hæna which studies the instances
in which some of the paccaya
relations do not exist between the
dhammas, but the others do exist.

158

The twenty-four paccaya relations are applied to these four great
divisions in the following six ways:
(i) Tika Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty-four paccayas are
applied to the dhammas in their
twenty-four Tika groups.

(ii) Duka Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty-four paccayas are
applied to the dhammas in their one
hundred Duka groups.

(iii) Duka-Tika Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty four paccayas are applied
to the dhammas in their one hundred
Dukas mixed with twenty-two Tika
groups.

(iv) Tika-Duka Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty-four paccayas are applied
to the dhammas in their twenty-two
Tikas mixed with one hundred Duka
groups.

(v) Tika-Tika Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty-four paccayas are applied
to the dhammas in the twenty-two Tika
groups mixed with one another.

(vi) Duka-Duka Pa¥¥hæna

The twenty-four paccayas are applied
to the dhammas in their one hundred
Duka groups mixed with one another.

The four pa¥¥hænas of the four great divisions when permuted with
the six pa¥¥hænas of the six ways result in twenty-four treatises which constitute the gigantic compilation of abstract Abhidhamma known as the
Mahæpakæra¼a or as the commentary and sub-commentary name it "Anantanaya Samanta Pa¥¥hæna" to denote its profundity and fathomless depth.
